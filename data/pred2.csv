"Taste really good. Love the place, nature nuance. Since the project paid all expenses, I didn’t know how much it costs 😁 but guessing it’s costly"
Udang bakar madu tasted ok but its served late and cold. Karedok tastes like rujak (sweet and over spicy). Cumi goreng lack of taste. By far the worse expensive sundanese.
"Wow... The owner have a good sense or art ... 👍👍, What else i can say... Nice theme and theme, lovely food and beverage, instagram content every corner at the building.  Mix and match everything in this restaurant was completed awsome, believed or not every breaking fasting all seat full book, better you take reservations before start the fasting days or Ramadhan come 😁.  For me... I am speechless to say this place have a negative spot.  Ok for your information try the ribs it was so yummy 🤤 and sweet and sour carp.  Recommended place to chill with your friends and family 👍😁"
"Going to jogjakarta for holiday isn't completed without visit this restaurant.  In this restaurant,  you can pretend become a rapunzel because their castle looks legit and real.  The foods taste are delicious and variant.  They just offered Indonesian sundanese food. You can choose either eat inside castle or in the backyards or 'saung'.  You can enjoy fish therapy for free!  For price,  it's a standard price (I mean not too cheap yet not too expensive also). Beside that,  they also offered service excellent, all of staff are friendly and helpful.  Make sure to come here!😄"
"Great place for a quiet meal. Good view, clean air! Seating : 4/5 gazebo style eating. Food : 3/5 simple food, nothing special Price : 3/5 Taste : 3/5 so so"
"The place is lovely and so peaceful !! Despite the construction site next-door, the environment of the restaurant is calm and relaxing. It didn't have various menus to eat, but the food quality was great. It was a total relaxing lunch when I visited there."
Interesting castle-theme restaurant. Staff is very friendly. Food is not bad too. Only hope that they could separate smoking and non-smoking.
"Food order was very fast and very yummy, especially udang bakar madu. Staff helpful and polite. One of my favs rest when visiting Jog."
"One of the best Sundanese Restourant in Jogja. Various selections of menu from fish, to chicken n vegetables. Place were very spacious, you can bring mpre tha  100 people here. There's also fishpond to for children to play around while you had a fish-byte therapy."
"A fine place, clean and themed like a medieval castle serving Indonesian cuisine, they have live music as well. It will be best if you reserve the table first and visit here in a medium to large group of people"
"We came on a non busy day for lunch with family of 7 in 2 separate cars, mostly elderly.  The nice touch is that they provide wheelchair for either the elderly or disabled. But it just baffled me, as the first step toward the entrance is a 10cm stair It'll be better if they provide ramp  The parking lot is adequate if not minimum considering table seating ratio  For a javanese living in tatar sunda for 30+ years,the food they served tastes rather sweet .."
"As a seafood lover, I highly recommend this place. It offers high-quality food (though not cheap) with nice view of a pond should you choose the ""lesehan"" area. Or you can choose to sit in the castle-themed building. While the area where it's located is accessible, Grab drivers, who took me there and picked me up, were not familiar with this restaurant, so you need to give them a clear direction."
"What can i say. The right place to celebrate anniversary, graduation, gathering with family or meeting with colleagues. Great food comes with such a great price."
"One of the best place to enjoy sundaneese food in Jogjakarta. Space in this restaurant quite spacious, suitable for large group."
"Parking area is more than enough, even bus can park here, many food choices, place is very nice, staff always helpful. Restroom is very clean, musholla also availabe"
"Mang Engking is a food chain in Yogyakarta and Central Java which is popular for their hot, savoury udang bakar madu (honey roasted freshwater shrimp/crayfish) and nice view. The Mang Engking in Soragan is located about 100 m from Jalan Godean, Sleman Regency and is quite close to the city. It is the second Mang Engking outlet in Yogyakarta Special Region. The outlet in Soragan stands out with a beautiful European Middle Age castle, with fish ponds and large halls for gathering. It is normally not crowded, except at certain occasions such as fast breaking time in Ramadhan (moslem fasting month). I think the foods here, especially the fabulous honey roasted shrimp, is slightly less delicious than those at the main outlet in Minggir. Both outlets have a unique attraction, especially for children: free therapy fish pond. Customers at this Soragan outlet can enjoy taking beatutiful pictures in the castle, or even enjoy their meals there."
Sometimes we still want to have fish meal at Jogja where usually most of meal is gudeg. Mang Engking is a good choice and recommended place
Es war sehr lecker und alles frisch zubereitet. Freundlich und sehr schnell. Wenn wir wieder in Jogjakarta sind  gehen wir wieder dort essen.
One of best family resto in town
Very nice restaurant with sundanese special taste. Their honey grilled shrimp is delicious. The atmosphere is shady with a few private huts. we are allowed to feed the fish in the pond with fish food provided by the restaurant
Wonderful place to eat! They served a whole food for a family at reasonable price
A perfect place for your company or family gathering. Nice ambience & many cool photo spots
"A cozy restaurant with Sundanese ambience, wide parking space, clean rest rooms, many seating options & various kinds of foods."
The best for Sundanese Food. Great Ambiance. Great Facilities. Instagramable spot (the Castle look-like) definitely a must!
"Tastes was nice, sambal was a bit different with other mang engking branch (more spicy i think)."
"Great atmosphere, with high ceiling main room. There are plenty of parking spots. Food was goooddd"
Great and cozy place and and delecios menu for eat. recomend for family and personal.  make a great moment in this place
"Went for a birthday celebration, interesting place, clean, good food, staff 👌, all in all positive experience"
"Very good in services, comfortable place for eat, tasty food in affordable price, easy to find from the main road, and this is the 3rd times I come here with my family. Also no need to be worried about parking lot here, they have a big one. Recommended for you and your family."
Tempat suasananya sejuk dan nyaman apa lagi masakannya enak poll dah 👍👌
"Unique building, nice food you can invite a lot of people in this restaurant.. The parking area is big"
"They called this Sundanese restaurant. I ordered Kepiting Saos Padang (crab with padang sauce) and Cah Kangkung (stir fry Kangkung). The crab less expected, the sauce should spicy but its not. The Kangkung are same, its hard to eat because they use to much stem than leaf.  The plus from this place is they have clean bathroom, big Mushola (moslem place for prayer) and fish pond therapy (doctor fish) for free. And also their have amazing castile 18th century in front of restaurant."
The food is great the place is feels so comfy. Definetely 10 out of 10.  There is a waitress who always stand by so its easy if you need help.
"Nice, relaxing place for lunch. Good food, their udang bakar madu is a must-try. Price is on the upper range."
Good place for family gathering. The place is very peaceful with lots of fish to see. Delicious and affordable food but very limited menu. Gurame bakar madu is our favourite ❤️
"There are actually 4 options of dining place there: 1. The castle: there were a lot of people having photo shoot at that time, wedding I assumed, so it was inconvenient to eat there. 2. The Spacious dining hall: we ended up here as my husband didnt like to sit on the floor (lesehan). He's not good at it, and people from his country don't have this culture. 3. The Lesehan section, next to dining hall. 4. The Gazebos: we didn't check. But most people choose to sit there. Food is below average. Don't expect too much :D the only nice thing there was just the honey butter prawn. The vegetable was somewhat 4 out of 10. What attract us more was actually the castle.. too bad we couldn't eat inside it."
"The food is fresh and delicious, but sometimes the fish and prawn is overcooked."
"Good place, good food. Yummy! Udang bakar madu is my fav."
"The taste of the food, for me is pretty good, although the price is pretty standard for a tourist spot, and the staffs are nice too. Overall, its a good place to try out, and it could be said that you're paying for the experience (decors, environment, etc)"
Sama seperti di Mang Engking di bsd... udang bakar madunya top dan iga bakar madunya lembut serta manis... 👍👌
"Great place and services, food is good"
"unique place, perfect dish, peacefull environment &  full of hospitality"
"The place was clean and spacious. There were a lot of empty seats maybe because we arrived later than lunch time. The food was okay, though. Unluckily, we got our food order mixed up."
"Delicious Indonesian menu. Great environment, humid atmosphere. Unique castle building."
"A good concept of Sundanese restaurant in the middle of Yogya. The place is a beauty, the food is quite good."
Mantap buat keluarga bisah trapi kaki ..cosss ikan nya mantap brooo
They have the menu in English but can't handle with tourists. I point the food I want and they totally change for a totally different one. I ask a juice without sugar and come with sugar. And it's a pretty disgusting have to take off the shoes to go to a very dirty and wet toilet! The other sudanese restaurant near is a lot better
"Food was so so, especially the crab. Atmosphere was nice. Pricing was normal."
"Nice n cozy space, delicious food n there are fish therapy too"
They provides seafood cooking. The place is very comfortable for family outing. There also fish teraphy for your feet.
"A good place for anyone. Be it local or foreign. Nice atmosphere, clean and good food."
"One of the best place for lunch with family, business, and while vacation I know. Very wide choices of Indonesian traditional cuisines.  The waiter/ress are all professionals and (i assume) trained accordingly."
Cosy and comfortable place to have dinner. Seafood is very fresh. Highly recommended!!
Hmm. This came highly recommended but it was below my expectations. The food smelled bad - the seafood (prawn and fish) were not good. The food left a lot more to be desired. I will not come here with high expectations. The ambience of long long tables like a dining hall does not make you feel like you’re in a nice restaurant but it’s slightly better than a dark warung..
Nice place and good tasted of food...
"Instagramable, friendly staff, good service, cozy and casual place"
"The Sundanese ambience is so real completed with Sundanese cuisine is best combination. Good for group visit, lots of tables and chairs. The staff is friendly and sprightful serving customer. The food offered is good grade and the important thing it's fresh."
Fantastic food and service. The place is beautiful and very relaxing. My friends and I had a wonderful time!
"Very big resto, offers choices of food with affordable price compared to Jkt"
"The place was nice, near paddy fields, have free fish spa for your pleasure. But the food are way too expensive!!! 3x more expensive than the other nice restaurant that we have been, also near paddy field with free fish spa. The quality of the food are the same as the previous restaurant mentioned but price too high."
"the place absolutely pretty. i also love their menu, especially their honey grilled shrimp."
Unique decorations. Tasty food. Great services. The best place to have lunch with family.
Gurame Cenghar one of the best spicy food..Nice Place
"Nyaman, makanan enak, sesuailah dengan harga nya..."
The food is good and the environment awesome
"the castle was too small: too crowded for 70 people, so the AC wasn't really sufficient, nor the air circulation; and people (other customers) kept walking through the castle to reach the garden behind the castle (thus our group's privacy was compromised). the design of the castle itself is supposedly trying to make a 'spacious' impression —with high ceiling and big&high windows— if not for the fact that it just wasn't designed to accommodate 70 people. the food is pretty good. the parking attendant was rude. the toilet was okay: clean and doesn't smell, but the flusher handle was missing.  overall, just average. saved from a 3-star because of the awesome bright-clean-spacious praying room."
"I think it's quite pricey here for the portions that aren't big enough. However, the foods are delicious and the view of the castle is also good for taking photos, especially when it's sunny^^"
"what a great place! like in an old building in England, feels like in the movie ""Harry Potter""🤣 the food is very delicious! perfect for bringing our family. The portions and prices are very appropriate. PERFECT!💯"
"Keunikan dari restoran ini adalah adanya tempat makan, yang menyerupai istana. Disini terdapat beberapa hidangan khas Sunda, yang berharga lebih tinggi daripada rumah makan Sunda di Jogja seperti Bumbu Desa, sehingga jangan hanya dikunjungi oleh seorang, melainkan juga banyak orang seperti sekeluarga atau sekawan. Meski begitu rasa hidangannya yang lezat sepadan dgn harganya karena hidangan (yg saya pesan) seperti iga bakar madu yg berasa manis gurih & bertekstur agak chewy, sambal tomat yg berasa asam manis pedas, dan bandrek yg berasa manis berempah menendang."
"food is excellent, is worth the visit when you come to Yogyakarta"
Masakan khas sunda dengan bangunan yang khas batu alam yang unik
5-star family restaurant! Great food Great ambiance! Pretty affordable tho!
"Ordered squid with salted egg, soft shell crab with padang sauce, stir fried beansprout and blackpepper oyster. All of them are delicious especially the salted egg sauce. The only lack for the food is the flour coating was too much, I personally think they'll taste better if they don't put too much flour on the squid and crab.  Ambience was nice, it suits any occasion for family"
"Food ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great selection of food, always go for the Udang bakar madu. They also have a good sambal.  Ambience ⭐⭐⭐⭐ The castle part is great for photoshoot, really big restaurant, great for big groups.  Cleanliness ⭐⭐ Need improvement with cleanliness. Table always feel so sticky (really dirty when u wiped it with tissue), and lots of ants.  Service ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Unlike other big restaurant which they will just greet and left u with the menu, in here they will wait for you and always try to serve you directly.  Recommended ? YES"
"Place: spacious dinning hall with some huts at the side. spacious parking lot. some instagramable spots including fish pond Location: quite easy to spot Food: so-so for me, sometimes lack of spice Staffs: some were friendly and helpfull Price: affordable  Overall experience was okay"
Tempat makan yg eklusive bersama relasi dan keluarga serta bersantai
"Went there last week with my mom and her gang, it’s cleaner and more aethestic than a few years back. Food was okay, but service was goooddd!!"
"A good place to eat with friends and family, the food taste is not to bad, must try it.."
"Warm, there are no fans in the area where we eat food."
Offering a complete recreation for the whole family... There's also a free fish theraphy while waiting for your food
When western style meet eastern taste
"Overall, this place's exceeded my expectations in every way. The combination of delectable grilled dishes, inviting ambiance, and excellent service made for an unforgettable dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant"
Nice sea food restaurant
"Good place, good vibe and good food. There are many indonesian food ranging from vegetables dish, seafood and the usual ayam goreng. My favorite was the sweet udang bakar madu and refreshing and crunchi karedok vegetable salad, yuuuum.  The staffs was very responsive and helpful even though my group was very demanding, thanks guys."
"Food taste delicious, very fast in serving what we ordered. Good for group or family. Sundanese ambience with bamboo decoration and big pond around.  Or tou can choose to heve the dine in at the castle."
"Gurame goreng kipas here is my father's favourite, other menu is good also..if you're looking for a family restaurant, this is one of the best in Yogyakarta..just don't forget to book in peak seasons so you'll get nice spot"
"Nice atmosphere while service was poor. I had to look around 15 minutes only to give the waiter some attention. Finally, had to walk to the reception to get someone attend to my orders.  The menu isn't detailed well for any foreign traveller. Was limited to order only the ones I already knew about."
Tempat makan yg recommended buat keluarga
"Delicious food, portion big enough. But the price is expensive for Jogjakarta standart. And the food is on the sweet side. Cozy and quiet place with beautiful photo spot"
"Good taste of traditional cooking, the fried tofu is simple but original. A bit pricey, the side main dining room smells a bit fishy, near the pond."
"Food is great, ambience is also good. But the services are slow. Took about 30 min for us to get the food eventhough when we are there not much guest was in the place"
"Poor quality of seafood, only strong in spice. Especially the prawn not fresh at all. At the beginning of the opening food quality was fresh. Yesterday the quality is terrible, however the price is 4* hotel"
"Nice food, but The Tidyness of the Place is not so good."
I came here with lecturers and staffs of Department of Agribusiness UMY. I love the food.
"good place, good time, with good friends.. happy fasting 1440 H🙏😁"
"Nice place for a brief getaway from your daily rush hour. The food is decent, the atmosphare is natural and refreshing. Food ingredients quality is great brings quite a fine taste to a country-side flavor."
"A nice restaurant for group dining. The setting is a typical Sundanese ""gubug"" or hut with fish ponds around the dining rooms. They play Sundanese traditional music all the times, which kind of completing the atmosphere. The foods are the standard fried/grilled chicken, fish, and other seafoods as well as many kinds of stir-fried vegetables with lalapan (fresh raw vegetables) and spicy sambals. They all are tasted goods, especially the grilled shrimps and the veggies dishes. They have a lot of seats, able to accommodate many group of guests at once. Praying room and restrooms are available for convenience. Reservations might needed for a big group dining."
Authentic Yogya taste (5 stars)
"The place is not bad although i didnt went into the castle(do they even permit people to go in there? I dunno) but the dishes there is good especially the grilled with sauce fish. It's super crispy even you can eat the fins also the shrimp is good. But i recommend you to add some lemon or lime to the shrimp it really tops up the taste or you can eat as it is. Although the place is still lose to their other branch restaurant in Gubug Mang Engking Minggir. If you like the place to be more calm and solemn then you should choose the ""Minggir"" one. It provides more scenery to see and it has more breeze."
"When you see from the outside is like you eat in the castle. Staff is polite and food is delicious. In here you can eat above fish pound and accompany with live fish under. Place is so big and clean, so good for group."
Price talks! Their seafood is the best so far in town. Very VERY fresh and rich taste. It won't waste much of your time since they serve the food quite fast.
Best seafood in town.. castle nya fotoable :D
"it wasn't worth the money. Sorry. Beef are chewy, tasteless. Takes time. Such a great building only good for photo session, or a pre-wedding photo session but not recommend for the food."
"castle is unique and has its own impression, not like in jogja, feels like in medieval times, musholla is comfortable, the ablution place and the toilet is clean, the car park is spacious, the fried chicken is good, the karedok is also pretty seer, the taste of the processed fish is standard, the waiter friendly."
"The castle here is such a draw...very classic but yet modern..amazing structure!! Honestly, I attracted to the building instead of the foods..lol it took an hour for the food coming at busy lunch...but weird, we're just happy explore the building and thinking how lucky is the owner to owned such an amazing place...hope will be back here to see it again...oh btw foods are fine like the  typical taste of mang engking everywhere."
"It's a really nice place, but ordered fresh melon juice and received something that was 95% water with some hints of melon - when I asked if it could just be melon juice no water they just added ice. Given it's a fancy place, they shouldn't cheap out on the juices."
"The place is very nice and comfortable, its Saung model. The menu offer variety of seafood and chicken meat. The toilet is very clean. Good place to rest your body."
Cozy restaurant in Jogjakarta that sells delicious seafood.
Very spacious and cozy space. Ethnic mix between Java and European architecture blend nicely. There are fish therapy which can be enjoy while waiting for dishes
This place served delicious meals. The shrimp is so delicious. It has a beautiful decorations such a castle and there is a fish that we can play with.
"Seafood not fresh, no taste, just big size. Prices are quite high for Jogja. Beside needing a large place for gathering, i do not see other reasons to go"
Wahh worth it banget
"It's a great place to have dinner with family. Friendly staffs, nice atmosphere, delicious food."
Many dishes to choose. Love gurame bakar and goreng cabe. The shrimps are fresh and it's a good choice for lunch and dinner for your family
"This is a real big restaurant with Sundanese nuance. You can have a relax time here, and nobody will disturb you, as I do now. Just order a coconut fruit and waiting my daughter finish her workshop here.  So, here are several room that can be used for many variative occasion. They also havw a big car park. Not to close from Yogya downtown.  It is good to be here.."
"Their udang bakar madu is the best one I've ever tasted. Also, their gurame is always fresh and crisp, either fried or grilled. Es cincau hijau is worth trying too."
Gezellig voor diner samen met familie
Great restaurant mostly sundanese food. The shrimp are great. With big castle so it is instagrammable and many prewed photograph take place here. Very big for meeting place.
Very good food and not so pricy.
Sundanese bistro that specialized in fish cuisine. Placed in a building decorated as a castle. It surrounding with interconnecting pools fully with fish. Taste good but the price is slightly expensive but it reasonable.
The fish was really good. Prawns were quite average. Loved the vegetables - Kang Kong and the tauhu and Tempe. Service was decent too.
"Cozy place for lunch/dinner with family, but the mosquitos at night.."
Lunch with sumatera's family long time didnt meet and nice place here
"Almost perfect, love to be here.. Horison always best like always"
"I recommend the sweet food like their shrimps, chiken, and fish with soy sauce"
"Good food, good atmosphere with pricy 😀"
"Spacious with good health protocols, food is excellent and place is wheelchair friendly. Seating choices are plenty with ample parking space"

good place to meet up or enjot with family
Good serving n taste... homy... clean...
"Have lunch inside a castle. They have two buildings, the first one with tropical sense and the second is a castle like. I like the castle better. The food is okay and waiting line is short."
Good atmosphere and good food
"Good place for meeting or big family / friend meeting. Udang madu is the best menu! The castle is part of this place, you can take a picture in there."
Sejuk enak utk makan keluarga
A very good ambience to have a dinner with lovely ones. The price is a bit expensive but the taste is worth to try. I guess this place is not really far from the center of the city
Perfect
"Nice and big place in Jogja. The place is really comfortable to dine in and enjoy the day. The food are yummy, the service also great. Thank you"
"Traditional javanese food, with large fish pond. Free large therapy fish for guest, relaxing and massaging your foot. There's also an european castle with its interior.. with two iron knight armour guarding the castle entrance.."
"The place is clean and comfortable, it's just the food feels less steady. And for the record you must order the chilli sauce separately."
"I recommend the honey grilled prawns, sweet soy sauce (kecap) grilled carp, deep fried carp, and spicy tomato relish (sambal tomat). As a side, I recommend the karedok, salad with peanut sauce."
Need clean and hieginic environtment to prevent food contamination by flies other insect or hair of cooker or food server.
Good restaurant for local and tourist. The menu are so varieted. Fish water and prawn. Bring family and enjoy it. Many nilem fish good for your theraphy.
"Place is cozy, music is relaxing, food is delicious"
Very good place to eatttttt
"Nice place but the seafood was way much too expensive compared to the others i have enjoyed, especially at Belawan"
Udang gakar madu is the bes. No one inthe world😁👍
"Huge, heritage, cultural, love this place. Price: lilbit above moderate but its compansed with the menu and the uniqe places"
nice food. worth it
전체적 음식 퀄리티도 안좋고 왜 레이팅이 이렇게 높은지 이해할 수 없음 그렇다고 맛있는것도 아니고 bakar를 시켰는데 goreng으로 가져와서 bakar라고 우기는 메니져나 식사중에 옆에서 빗자루질하는 종업원.... 파리는 테이블 위를 날아다니고 걷모습은 좋지만 내부는 최악이었던곳 두번다시 가기싫고 구글 레이팅도 못믿겠음
One of my favorite restaurants when I go to Yogya..the most delicious food is honey grilled prawns
"The food ia okay, but it takes a lot of time to prepare. Better come between 12.00 pm to 13.00 pm, because after 13.00 pm it's so crowded and have to wait on waiting list"
"“sea food lover need to come here” sea food lover need to come here, they server a big prawn / shrimp, they cook a good Indonesian 'gurame', can be deep fried, can be grilled."
"I love the place, it's so relaxing while eating, and the food is good, yummy and affordable.. The service isn't bad. It's satisfiying 😍😍😍😍"
"Great ambience. Good food for family, seafood especially. Children welcome. Baby chair available."
"Great atmosphere and beautiful place, especially at night. The food is pricey though, and I only truly recommend their udang bakar madu."
"Good food, the atmosphere is relaxing and quiet since the place is on the outskirt of the city. Great for groups and spend your time here"
"Good place for eating out, great food,  with pond around the dining hall. Try fish treatment by dipping your feet in the  ponds."
Great food. Nice and cozy restaurant. Great value with the packet menu so we can tasted many of the dishes.
Service could be better.. Foods are good.. Beverages kinda so so.. Overall cozy place to eat
