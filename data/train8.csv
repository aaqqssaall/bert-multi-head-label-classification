review
Nice restaurant with great taste and food, the Ambience also nice
Good for groups and quick bites. 24hours.
Food is good and delicious. The waitresses and security are so helpful and friendly. I would come back again next month with my loved one for sure.
Nice place to take a rest for a while. But the menu should be more various. The price and the taste is OK
I think there are 2 Raminten's kitchen around this area. The first thing we did after we got there was registering for the queue and they would call us if the table is available. Took a long time to wait, but they provided seats inside the Restaurant.  Mostly serving Indonesian foods, but not only Javanese foods. I'm not sure if the price was included 10% tax, but it was quite cheap for us.
The food is amazing except for the fact that the waiting for the food itself was 2 hours long. Seriously it was so long but the food should've been easier to serve and cook. If you want to visit this place just visit The House of Raminten.
If you are expatriate and looking for a place to enjoy yogya vibes, this place is perfect for you. They offer some traditional food and drink with reasonable price There are many good spot to take picture also.
tastes slightly different from the original one with more modern building and interior
Comfy place, positive ambience, great food 👍 , refreshing drinks
till I finished my Geprek Noddle, my drink still didnt come. two waiter told me to wait and the third one told me that they still have to wait for clean glass.  DISAPPOINTED!!!
Pretty disappointing. Food is lackluster but ok. Nice atmosphere though
The place is cozy. I feel like I'm eating at home. The food is okay, cheap but tasty. The beverages are good, cheap too. Overall is a good place. Would like to come again
Photo shown is mie geprek. you can set your preference level of spices here (certain foods). Place is nice and u ique, however can be better if the aircond is cooler as the place is quite near to the kitchen (literally reflects its name). Price range is around IDR 3,000 - 25,000. The location is just the opposote of its main group branch called House of Raminten. But here is serving more simpler foods and somewhat cheaper than the House of raminten.
Nice fried noodle.  Bumbu nua lekoh, berasa
Very nice! Thank you for a good food and experiences!
I like the food I like the place and the staff friendly, today first time I going to this restaurant and I like it, next time I would try another food
The service's really good, so homey, sangat merepresentasikan Jogja, the food is 9/10, mba dan mas nya gercep. Overall is good, will be back again for sure 👌🤌
Terkenang selalu dengan tempat ini. Selamat jalan Pak Hamzah... besar jasami di dunia ini.
It serves tasty food at good prices. The place is simple, clean, and cozy.
Strongly recommended. The food was delicious and the environment was so relaxing. Moreover, the price is almost same as the price of the street food. It is worth eating here.
nice place with good ambience to hangout with family.
The food was good and the ambience and the atmosphere was even better. For those who seek cultural dining in Yogyakarta, this is the best place, and the price was also affordable.
Good foods, good place n ambience, friendly price, and it has many kind of traditional or Indonesian special food.
What a good place to go with your foreign friends! It's not quite cheap but worth enough.
they serve a lot of javanese food. beautiful place, nice decoration but the service was not so good.
Delicious food and drink and also good for meet up with your friends
A long que, we didnt get a chance to be in. Not good for family with kids to wait
We had late night dinner after attending the Ramayana dance. The food was just so-so. But I do like the atmosphere. It's Java. Javanese culture at its best. All waiters were dressed in traditional Javanese dress. Some people were training the traditional Javanese dance in a platform in the garden, lit by bright light. The songs played were Javanese. Do come and enjoy the atmosphere.
Average food good service a bit pricey
This famous Restaurant of Yogyakarta, it sell some merchandise as well. Unik place to hang out and instagramable. You must visit this is in Yogyakarta.
I like that they serve Sayur Asem. But unfortunately, sometimes it's served cold and it's a bit difficult for short customers, like me, to take it from the pan themselves.
Un lugar bastante pintoresco. Comida aceptable ambiente local. Mezcla diferentes tipos de comida. El precio es bastante ajustado. Merece la pena conocerlo.
Very clean and welcoming place. The food portions are really big here. The prices are reasonable. The staff are very friendly and attentive.
Big portions with affordable price👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 The taste was good also. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Good place, if you could not queu in Raminten House. Same food taste, and atmosphere
Uno dei migliori ristoranti di Yogyakarta. Standard completamente occidentali bellissimo ambiente e personale molto cortese. Cucina e piatti elaborati e di ottima qualità.
The food's amazing with affordable prices and it opens 24 hours.  Very traditional ambiance yet comforting. All smoking area cover.  Never come to this place when rush hour. The waiting list will be amazing. I waited 45 minutes at dinner time for 2 people. Imagine when you came with your friends more than 4 people.  Overall it's a great place.
Affordable price, best taste, many kinds of food like traditional food and beverage. But you have to be patient for the long queue.
The food is quite good and big. The waiters are also nice. The problem is the time taken to make the food, I waited for at least 1.5 hours! Then the waiter came and said, "Sorry, it is out of stock"... I was trying to be patient at that time, and ordered a different meal, finally, after around 20 minutes of waiting, the food came. I took around 2 hours just waiting for the food to came. That's just my personal experience (I hope they can increase their chef to process the food faster).
Good food, good place, affordable price
Been here for several times.. good food n good price.. keep it up!!
served unique food & beverages.. had a good javanese atmosphere here.. but long waiting list make you bored
Has few Similar menus but with more spacious environment. Try the ayam geprek. The fried chicken is one of the best in Yogya tbh.  There are beers for you who likes to drink and dine. Relatively standard for price. The waiting time could be hell if this place is crowded
the menu is unique, full of appetizing simple kampung delights, but it tastes average. the waiter/tresses are always in a rush, its good but somehow bad as well since it made them answer your question regarding the menu with simple and unclear replies.
A must visit place when you come to Yogyakarta. Sense the atmosphere of traditional and unique javanese style here. Affordable price and tasty foods and beverages.  But sorry, it is usually a bit crowded, even you will have waiting list to enter. So now you know why it is recommended. Worth to try
The restaurant is filled with java culture style. But the menu is mixed with traditional and modern style. There is some place for eating in the yard with 'fun' feels. The menu is good, the price is not too expensive, but there are some menu are not available. Overall is recommended for dinner with family or friends👍👍
It's an unique restaurant where you can enjoy traditional Javanese food and drink. It's also a great place to hang out with friends since they also serve the food and drink in quite big portion and not so expensive. Moreover, the open 24 hours so it's good for all the nighters. Unfortunately, if you go here on normal hours, it's a bit uncomfortable. You have to queue at least 1 hour.
The restaurant atmosphere is good.. reflect the traditional java concept. Service excellent. But sego ndeso we ordered a bit tasteless.. also need to improve more javanese menu.
TERRIBLE experience there. 🤮🤮  That place does NOT deserve the good ranking it has in Google maps... I suspect they are buying good reviews  1. The place is filthy dirty. The staff doesn't even care to clean the tables after customers finish eating. We had to insist 2 times to get the trash out of out table after we arrived.  2. Staff at the entrance (3 staff just hanging out there at the entrance) really without education, didn't even say "hello" and sent us to check by ourself to check if there was a table available  3. After 15min waiting for a staff to pas our order, we had to ask 3 times and wait 15 min more before somebody finally took our order  4. Overpriced, more than 2x normal price in the area and food below average  5. The staff didn't even answer to our "goodbye" when we left  In CONCLUSION, there is visibly zero management at this so-called restaurant, and all the staff we met had absolutely no education.  better PASS your way. Don't lose your time and energy in this miserable place. 🤮
The place is unique. The owner has created the restaurant with nuance of magic, the scent of  jasmine is everywhere. It is an open space restaurant. I think it used to be a front yard or terrace of a big house. When visited this place we were on school holiday. It was so crowded. We have to wait and a lady take note of guest on waiting list. Then we waited for about an hour for dinner. The food was not so good. It was cold. But the price was cheap. One note about this place that attrack people is the uniqueness. But not with the food.
Very long queue so dont go there on empty stomach. We waited like 1 hour to get a table for 6 people. Price is very reasonable. Food is just average although they have funny cheeky name. Dessert on the otherhand is very good especially if you like traditional Indonesian dessert. Open 24 hours so they claimed but several items we want to ordered are out of stock. Parking is difficult so prefer to get there by Grab car.
Nos lo recomendo el hotel, y repetimos al dia siguiente!! Genial de precio y todo buenisimo. Cantidades super abundantes y servicio de 10!! Hay varios en Jogyakarta y merece la pena!
I was dining alone last night. It wasn't a great experience since most people dining with friends or family. They're not providing a single traveller sitting and dining alone apparently. So I got to sit on a seat set of four. This joint selling something more to cultural setting than the great food, not to mention the horse stall in the back right to the kitchen etc, for some people it's not they cup of tea. Not too bad though.
Good job. Very nice
The food served here is so delicious. I'm loving their drinks. The atmosphere is very mystical, mysterious indeed with a lot of Javanese-esque statues and decorations. Not too expensive too, a good place to eat while you're at it.
Dined here yesterday and all in all I was not let down. The atmosphere here is mystical and traditional and you'll see many odd decorations around. As for the foods, they were great! Could've gone easy on the MSG but they were delicious nonetheless. The drinks were a bit too sweet for my liking, I ordered 'Monster' and all I could taste was sugar water with a hint of lemon and lemongrass. It should be the other way around. Despite all that, the pricing still makes sense. I enjoyed it!
The restaurant is pretty nice with javanese ornaments but the food is a bit pricey
Self service but food is cheap and very very good. Fried chicken is delicious.
If you want to experience the new concept of eating, just come here. You'll feel the different atmosphere right when u arrive. The uniqueness of old Java concept, tasty and unique meal, and the plus is affordable price make this place worth a try! They open 24 hours by the way
Adopting a fast food order taking, but at a very slow serving time. A friend ordered fried rice and it come out in hours. No lock on the toilet 😅
Perfect at 3am after partying! Delicious food. Great hangout. Make certain though, that the waiter lets you know if they ran out of anything before you order! :-D  We ordered 3 of one dish...waited for over 30 minutes...and he brought only one and said that it was the last one. Service is slow...but hey-- it's lovely being the only ones there!
The price is unbelievably for its quality.. strongly recommend this place for lunch
Great Ambience. Great Music. Great Food. Reasonable price. I just love it!!
Artsy place. The food and beverage are fine. They open 24 hours
Super UNHAPPY, it's was only few tables occupied (not busy) when we arrive, and we've ordered. Then suddenly the place are fully, but So unfortunately our foods still not coming, funny fact, the foods of the newest customers who's coming way far before us, they got their foods already, HOW COME?  Not even a while we've been waited for our friends Main course coming for 1hour 28minutes. Even the drinks are supposed to arrived at the first before the meals came. This is very disappointed ☹️. This is super 😭.
If you visit Jogjakarta，you Must come here! They are one of the iconic restaurant in Jogjakarta!  Great food, great traditional vibes.. need a little service improvement since there's always crowds around, the waiters needs to be trained more about service
Food is great , staff are polite, it feels like home and portions are big so your tummy will be full🤤💪👍
Very unique place, featuring wooden house for dining area, many unique statues and funny quotes hung on the wall. Serves Indonesian and some Jogja's specialty. Must visit place. The price is inexpensive and the food is delicious.  Definitely must 'visit' the bathroom and you will find a surprise
This place decoration and ambience is very unique. The waiter and waitress uniform is unusual. The foods and drinks are not to special, but you cannot find it in any other places. The price is standard. At least you have to visit once when visit Yogyakarta.
The concept is unique. Btw you can see and take photos with horse, here.
Unique place, even you have to wait for the table you can sit on the chairs available while watching the big screen playing some traditional event like traditional dance.  The ambience surrounded by the smells of jasmine. The price is cheap and the food comes with quite big portion. Really like this place <3.
When I see the crowd queueing for table, I expect to have a good food for dinner. After about 20 minutes queue, we were directed to the table.  Ordering menu was fun, the attendant was helpful and payment was directly with the attendant. Very sistematic and hassle free.  Portion of the foods and beverages were big for the price. Taste was plain, below my expectation.  Environment was cozy and unique, with traditional Javanese style here and there. There were several horses near the toilet. Statue of the owner was also unique.  Verdict: Good place, not so good food.
Nasi goreng seafood & bakmi goreng were too sweet (even for our Javanese taste buds).  Too pricey for the taste. Not worth the value at all.  No birthday promotion.  Es teller wasn't es teller at all. Es teller should be avocado, coconut, & jackfruit. But no avocado & coconut, instead only some jelly. Though the size is quite big. Not recommended.  So many menu were unavailable Snacks are ok for mendoan & otak2.  The only good here was the friendly staff.
Etnik...unik...ah pokoknya mari luwe ne...
I ordered fried rice here since no other food except fried chicken available at 9 PM. The food is so so but the atmosphere is good. They sure have good vintage music. You can enjoy the dinner with your family or late night alone in this nice place.
One of many tourist objects in Jogjakarta. Prices here are cheap compared to other big named restaurant. If you go to here at peak hour, be ready to wait a bit long to get your seat. For the foods, for me it is not as delicious as I expected. Atmosphere is a bit creepy for me.
Good authentic Indonesian - Javanese restaurant...
swasana nyaman, staff nya okei n ramah
Super unique, fun but a lil bit mystical place for vacation. Comes with unique menus as well
Great place, they have traditional menu from appetizer to dessert.
The staff made so much noise. The music was too loud, I had to speak louder just to talk with my friend sitting next to me!!! It's really uncomfortable. The food? You can find cheaper food with much better taste. I was really dissapointed. I really don't know why people gave 5 stars.
Fast services, Good Place for dinner.
Sehr gemütlich, ein wenig kitschig, aber genau das macht den Flair aus (Jesus steht neben Buddha und einem Dalmatiner )! Es gibt sowohl Tische als auch Sitzmöglichkeiten am Boden. Samstag abends muss man mit kurzen Wartezeiten rechnen. Die Bedienung ist freundlich, fesch und flott. Das Essen ist sehr günstig und extrem gut, man kann sich super durchkosten. Unbedingt besuchen, wenn man in Yogyakarta ist!!!!
If you reduce the salt by 20%, it would be perfect.
the atmosphere is kind of mix between traditional Javanese mystical, culinary and a lot of comedy. the menu is great and cheap. Remember that you must registered and line in queue first before dining since the seats are limited.
This place offers various traditional foods and drinks with affordable price and decent taste. It operates 24 hours and is a great place to hangout with friends. The unique decoration and ornaments makes this place become a must visit place for people if they ever come to jogja.
Love the presentation of interior from "Raminten Kitchen". The ambience and design follows traditional era of Javanese style with combination of table seating and floor seating (lesehan). Food and dishes are delicious and has lots of varieties. There are many mystical beliefs hence many ornaments and displays placed. Waiting lines are very long so be sure to call for booking reservation before you come.
I really, really loved it being there. You can eat with family or friends, in a small or large group. It's cozy and unique, with soothing dupa scent and lesehan style of seats, but if you prefer lawn chairs, there are those too. It's dim and quite peaceful, with javanese traditional instrumental music playing in the background. The price is very affordable and worth it for a place as well-known as this one. Also, the coordination between the waiters are very nice. You don't need to wait to order your food, they are always there ready to serve. And it doesn't take long for your order to come. In fact, it comes almost instantly. Love it.
I don't understand about the whole fuss about this place. The wait is always long; i had to wait for 1 hour before finally seated. The food was just ordinary javanese food you could find at many places around Jogja. Restroom was dirty and not well maintained. Kitchen area was awful, especially since the dish-washing area was combined with 4 pet horses in cages 😱 (explains the manure odor during dining). Will i revisit? Absolutely not!
Great place if you want local! No tourist in there :) Atmosphere really chill, sitting on the floor, eating at low wooden table. Food and service was not excellent but like most places in Java. We had a great time feeling the local vibes.
Maaf utk sayuran di selat iga perlu tetap dijaga kesegarannya
This is a really nice and very traditional place. The food is fairly good and have a very big portion, and the price is super cheap. It open 24hr and it's good place for hanging out with family/friends. on weekend or national holiday you better prepared for long queue.
Waited 3 hours for the food to come out, due to crowded customer, saturday night, but cannot be cancelled as the order has been processed, and the resto was short of staff due to covid19 pandemic. The noodle soup also was only warm not hot and taste not as good aa expexted
The house of Raminten was highly recommended on TripAdvisor but my experience is very bad, the restaurant is very dirty, many bugs crawling on the table, food is limited at 1am even it is 24hrs restaurant, staff is not friendly and the drink is to sweet, food taste normal, sate serve cold. I don't recommend this unless you have nothing to do or no places to visit. 这家餐厅在TripAdvisor的人气很高，但是我个人觉得非常糟糕！餐厅里非常不干净，桌子里有非常多的昆虫，24小时的餐厅在凌晨一点没有食物选择，饮料非常甜，食物非常普通，烧烤沙爹牛肉是冷的。我个人不建议这家餐厅，员工们不友善也没有特色，除非你没有任何地方去。
Delicious food fun atmosphere
Our dinner with two friends from Japan. Very nice.. They really liked this place..
So good for sharing.. its worth
makanan dan minumannya enak semua 😍
Good view so unique, Waiting list..
unique dining places with gotic style and affordable prices
Traditional restaurant, nice place, full music of gamelan, delicious foods
Supposing to be a super cheap and nice place to dine. Overall the food isn't bad, just that the queue is quite long and you may have to wait awhile. In addition, the portion may be small to foreigners, but do take note not to over order as well.  Not every table has a chair so you might be sitting on the floor mat like traditional eating places in Indo.
Actually ate here 3 times during my stay in jogja, cos of the reasonable pricing and it was rather easy for a tourist like me to order as there's pictures in the menu to order. Down side was the popular stuffs like a garang asem is always sold out.  Most stuffs are good but the fried chicken tend to be a bit too tough and some of the drinks are either too sweet or diluted (juice).  Expect to queue if you're here during peak hours.
It's so hype, sometimes people have to queuing. But the taste good for some items.
Cozy n vintage place to hang out....
“appealing, interesting, so unique” Reviewed November 25, 2013 the atmosphere is made to create a mystical experience, with incense sticks, flowers in water container and such as. however, it's only accessories. The restaurant opens 24 hours, serving various traditional javanese or typical Yogyakarta food. The name, in Indonesian / Javanese words are sound intriguing and unusual. You can see horses and small istals on the way to restroom. Price is cheap, no need to worry, there is no hotel price in this place.
I just love the atmosphere, you can feel the scent of incenses and flowers arround the restaurant. The price is affordable and sometimes it is so crowdy, you need to wait a certain time to be seated. The foods have unique name but taste ordinary, less spices than usual indonesian food, but it isn't bad at all. The waiters are helpful and fiendly. The payment will be immediately made after you order and waiter calculate it. You'll also find souvenirs shop here.
This place offers an Amazing food, and also a comfortable and cozy place, very close to other popular areas such as malioboro, this place is rather popular making it a prime option for other traveller searching for food.  Expect delays, because when you ordering food you need to enter a line system making it feel like a waste when you eating alone, but in group this place offers a very good option.  Try to go to this area not in holidays, and weekends because going in that time likely result in you going to starve because of the long line and crowded place.
I loved this place, the traditional ambience, the concept, the cheap price and the food&drink, bakmi jawa and wedang uwuh is my fav. This place is so crowded especially in weekend, so you may wait to get ur seat. The food and drink have big portion so its better to sharing with ur friends. And the other poin plus, this place open for 24 hours. Wanna comeback to this place again for sure, i wanna taste the garang asem
The atmosphere was very nice and warm for family gathering! For the food also HELLA GOOD! 24/7 restaurant! Always clean and comfortable to stay in!
Raminten is a spatious traditional restaurant that serve foods and drinks. The menu has unique name, delicious taste, and the price is not too expensive. It is a nice place to eat and enjoy the night with friends or family. This place is worth it to visit and you will get pleasant experience. But, you must be patient to visit this place. Because you must waiting in a queue list to eat here.
Awesome place!!! One of my favourite restaurant in Yogyakarta. The place is really cozy and homie to spend the time and also to talk with family, relatives, friends, and someone else. You could feel the vintage style of the place with traditional musical instrument of gamelan, the smell of incense added the impression of old style and the waiters wear traditional culture clothes from Yogya. The foods and drinks are also nice for breakfast, lunch or dinner because the restaurant open 24 hour everyday beside on the day set by them. The menu is offering the unique flavour of tastes which is comparing modern and traditional meals especially in Yogyakarta. Furthermore, they use antique stuffs to serve the meals and the restaurant also serve suitable food for vegan.
Very crowded place with a very long queue every weekends or holidays. The interior is so unique and traditional. The waiter and waitress are wearing javanese costume. The food are various from traditional to modern.
overall oke bgt i really like how the atmosphere is so traditional and warm!
A unique and sophisticated place for hanging out. Javanese interior, great foods, and affordable prices, make this place popular among people. But consider about the time, because of the tables are limited despite of huge number of visitors.
The food is good, service is excellent, and i just love the enviroment there ♥️
Nice and unique menu.. I try this one called Melonkolis..
We waited 1 hour to get our food and nothing special about the food. Seriously why is this place famous?
beautiful and large place. they decorated the place according to their tradition, so it creates a certain vibe. the food was good too. versatile menu of Indonesian traditional food.
Thanks to mas who's letting me know this place. Must place to go kalo ke Jogja!
Unik & khas..
The only place I know in Jogja that opens 24h. Good traditional food, nice herbal beverages, plenty of menus to choose from. Good place to hang out with your friends. One thing though, for Jakartans who are used to fast service, you need to be more patient here hehehe. And for those of you who are "sensitive", better say your prayers the second you enter the premises.
While this place is really popular in Yogyakarta, the price is still cheap and reasonable. The staffs are really polite and offer quick service. It provides quite wide options of local food and beverages.
I love the original Raminten’s restaurant vibe, the Raminten’s Kitchen gave a different vibes from the original one (which  located just 500 meters apart), but it was fancy and comfortable, the food choices are authentic and traditional. The bonus part is they had this javanese ritual or ceremony to respect the food, every 21.00pm. The price is a little bit pricey, and you must be patient enough to wait for the food to be serve.
July 2023  Very decent local food with good ambience (sit on the garden grounds for a true local experience)!  This is prob a better option for tourist than House of Raminten (it's very very crowded there).
Full of traditional music gamelan.. The food is good
Good food and very friendly staffs!
Marem gandem santai ramah
A very comfortable place to eat, to talk with friends/colleagues or just to study. The place is clean, the service is fast, and the food is delicious! It might get a little crowded in the noon, though, but overall, I'd love to visit here again.
A good place to visit. It has the decorations of javanese colonialism so this place is Instagram-able. As for the menu, it seems that they only serve half the menu of the main branch.  However, if you happen to visit this place, I would recommend the fried chicken. The original one, not the geprek one, since the geprek version gives different taste. I think it is better than other chicken products and arguably the best one in town, especially if you like rich spices.
It was nice place and always crowded so you must get a waiting list. The traditional food was good but lacks of spices, have a decent price with great ambience. Good service so far! Good gamelan music too
It’s a rite of passage that every visitor to Jogja has to eat here at least once. Certainly unique, you sit on the floor and eat small dishes between a group. Amazing value for money, you’ll just have to wait a while to get a table.
If you come here for food and ambiance, this is a good place to go. While waiting for special menus, you can also take pic. So instagrammable. All of the waitress are very kind. The payment method is also available cashless.. yuhuuu
The most famous restaurant in jogja (i guess!) We came here 4 times during our 6-day trip in jogja. Our first time here, everything seemed so cheap (i mean it) and also the drinks were so cheap (12 or 14k for one huge glass of almost pure apple juice). The foods were also very yummy and very javanese. The ambience was also very ancient and you really felt like you're in countryside (or a temple tho). There incense and flowers on some corners. The peak time is at 7 until late night. We ever came here at 10 or 11 sth and we have to wait for 20 minutes to get our seat! Oh the good news is they open 24 hrs! So if you don't feel like eating gudeg, just go to raminten to get your belly fixed!
Raminten kitchen is different to House of Raminten. The concept is more casual. I'd say it is like Raminten express. But they have a cozy and clean place. Food is ok. Not so much option but still in a good standard. Considering that the location is not in the main road, it is perfect for your simple getaway with friends or even just yourself alone.
If you are interest in Javanese traditional foods and atmosphere, you have to go to this place
Fantastic authentic Indonesian experience. The atmosphere, food & drinks and service were excellent. Highly recommend this establishment.
Order only to waitress girl, you should pay right away. Waitress guy served the food and take the empty plates. There are only 3 waitress girls, be patient until they are taking orders from other table. The girl waitress sometimes is not focus and made mistakes. Please ask her to recite oder list.  Mostly the food is alright. Nothing special. But, the atmosphere is very javanese.
One word, delicious.
Was already expecting average food and variations of desert and beverages, and somewhat unique ambiance.. Sat outside, I can smell toes..  Nasi goreng below expectasion, wife thinks it's quite nice. Telur bakar is omelette with soy sauce and sambal terasi, meh! Nasi bakar, rawon, rica-rica was out.. Pepes tuna is okay.  Desert and beverages are okay, but still nothing special. Service is nice and fast. We sat outside, and it smells like toe!
Last time i ate at Raminten's restaurant at kali urang, now i got a change to try Warung Raminten Kitchen at Jl Sabirin. Wow, they got 2 floor, spacious places, they got outdoor area, and many objects to see, got two horse, birds, dokar, etc.. They got a enough parking area also, accept cashless payment.. The food taste was very nice, is not to expensive, and also bigportion..
I waited for about an hour just to enter the restaurant.. and i waited for another hour for the foods that are not that great. A little disappointing. But the good thing is that they have this waiting area with a tv and some chairs. The prices for the foods are cheap. The waitresses use a traditional clothing.
Nice place to sit and enjoy the scenery, very instagrammable place! There's a huge cart in the middle of the restaurant, the waiter and waitress wearing traditional javanese dress. The food also cheap!
Interesting place with Javanese signature. The foods are normal and the price is okay. Not my favorite place because it is very touristy now. But I like the ambience here.
Nek suasana é menyenangkan njawani tapi wayah mêtu panganan kok njelehi opo maneh rasaning panganan soto bathok nganggo sendok kayu malah mambu kayu lawas
The place may be so artistic and unique with traditional Javanese design, the foods are also at affordable price. Unfortunately, the food taste was so so 😐 (chicken in the Gudeg was hard to chew), as well as the beverage.
Last week I went there. It was crowded., It was holiday season. Unique place ,and unique menu. LOL😄 Nice place to do chit chat with friends. I ordered monster drink ( ginger,lemon, lemongrass) and fried rice. I take home the little poster. "Raminten" 😊
Well i came at 6.30 pm, the queue long enough. I am the 7th waiting list during I was waiting it getting more and more longer. Some registered names were called but they had gone. They were cenceled. Finally I canceled. Well it will not be chill anymore when you go there in big season. Even though food looks good. You can not be relax in hectic.
Good food, friendly staffs, a cozy place with traditional Javanese vibes. Es dawet is my personal favorite, might as well recommend it for first timer.
Extremely affordable place to eat but just know the food is reasonable with the price. The food is decent if you're looking for a place for cheap eats and quirky atmosphere.  I would call to make a quick reservation before going. This place is extremely busy with locals.
The place has its own vibes. Youll find a good service with a very strong javanese culture. With such place with a stable in it, it doesnt smells that bad, eventhough you must go throught the stable if you wanted to go to the bathroom. A very delicate place
It's a good place for dining in the morning till night. It serve local food and provide many menus from food to beverage. The place is also cozy as many visitors come to visit this place. It opens for 24 hours.
I love the ambience, I love the food. Open 24 hours, this place must be visited when you in Yogya. And you can buy bakpia mini 👌🏻 soyummyyyyyyy especially the cheese one
It's a good place, a great ambiance, and food is delicious. If you are the person who likes strong taste of species it is the right place
Always crowded. The mie jawa is the best. Big enough so u didn't need anything else after eat it😀😀.... And if u like to watch on male with sexy body and good looking face.... Here's the place😇😇.... The place had some mystical aura. But it's alright. No need to be affraid. It's cool to have a dinner there with your friend or family. And u should visit it while u in jogja
nice restaurant... provide a lot kind of meal... have to queue for eat there... but (for me) i did'nt like the smell from "dupa"... make me hard to breath... and for musholla is too small... only enough for 4... and the sit for lesehan not comfort for me... but over all nice...
Overall was good. The food, the place, the decoration was unique. But the smells, nope i don't like it. And almost forgot, the waiters just so beautiful 😂
If you like to sit down low this place is the go. Great food and a very different atmosphere. Theatre seating waiting area. Horse stables near the toilets. Check out the lovely big lady.
It's a unique place, with unique interior design.. So traditional like you can smell "menyan" haha.. I have to be on queue line for like half an hour, but it's worth the wait bcz they've got nice foods with affordable prices.
The place is so nice to spend the time with family and friends. The waiter and the waitress are so warm and good to serve customers. There is woman who did Batik Tulis, so we could see how to make Batik Tulis live.
The House of Raminten offers delicious food at an amazing price. This place has it all. Wacky yet entertaining decor and a waiting room because this place is super popular. There is a little Batik shop up front for those who want something to do while waiting for food but if you wander around the resto, you'll see wonders.
Get ready to wait for a long time. This place is better as a hangout than as a diner, so if you want a quick bite, you had better go somewhere else. If you want to hang out, they have a variety of funny beverages and foods.

Best atmosphere, best staff service, very helpful and polite, good quality of food and open for 24 hours 👍 really recommend you guys to visit
Delicious Food at cozy place with reasonable price
The food is good and beautifully cheap. The decoration is oddly nice and the is quite comfortable. So, come here next time you stop by in Yogyakarta.
This restaurant is not the same as the other house of raminten.. They serve ayam geprek and friend rice as their main menu.. And they have a unique concept that after their costumers finish their meals they have to clean it up themselves.. But the atmosphere is nice and clean, and if you go there in the afternoon you can see the horse racing course just next to the restaurant..
Good ambience to eat javanese food..
Nice food nice services with spooky environment...
Like a mysitic restaurant, you will find "dupa" and "menyan" scent there..
A very atmospheric restaurant with friendly waiters. The food is cheap compared to another traditional-modern restaurants with variety of options and overall great food. Usually crowded at night, but there's a waiting room in front so you can wait for the next table to be empty.
So so food, with so so price. Rp16K (1.5 USD) for a meal with rice and chicken and tamarind soup (sayur asem). The room is air-conditioned, they cook there, and seemingly there's no exhaust fan, or not enough if there's any at all. So sometimes, when there's a lot of cooking in there, there'll be a lot of smoke too. And spicy smoke triggers a lot of sneezings. So you go upstair, where you can sit in an open air place and smell the fresh air, no smoke, but you can also smell whatever the smell of horse pen next to the restaurant. But at least you have a choice, horse pen or spicy smoke.  Tips, do not buy the botled sweet tea from the fridge which cost you 10K, but ask for ice tea for 5K, and get free refill.  And when I ate there, the music were evergreen oldies, and not gamelan. "Why can't we be like storybook children....?"
A place which sells 'ayam geprek' and 'sayur lodeh' in modern level :) You can find their menus in street stalls around Jogja with more reasonable prices and taste though. But... I really appreciate the effort to educate the costumers to service themselves after eating; to put the dishes to the sink and throw off the trashes (tissues, banana leaves, bottles) by themselves. Unfortunately, not all the costumers aware of it and leave the dishes and trashes on the table.
Really love the concept of Javanese culture in it. The menu is good even it's little bit pricy. They use close bill system. It is perfect for group dining.
A millenial style of Raminten with self-service cafe, open 24 hours, affordable menu's prices, comfort place, good vibe for discuss and chatting with friends. It consist of 2 floors and wide parking lot.
This restaurant is a joke... They make you queue half an hour before sitting. Menu is actually regular food you can find anywhere else, furthermore at 21.00 half of the menu is already not available... Waiters blurp next to you! Food is ok, nothing exceptional
All menus are traditional foods from Jogja and Central Java, the taste is good and exactly have a friendly price. The place and ambience is very traditional with some gamelan music.
The place is iconic with its traditional Javanese look. The service is also pretty fast and good. However, you have to be smart when you choose the menu because some are a bit pricey
Serving time was bad. 50% of first ordered food had to be cancelled and changed (after 15-20 minutes wait) due to “sold-out”. Taste was average.
House of Raminten. Antree tp unique dan cepat
Great foods with the cheap price! The place was also good for hanging out with friends. For studying or do some work maybe you can use the 2nd floor of the restaurant.
Enak tapi mistic ada patung n sajen bungaaan
24 hours ethnical restaurant with cheap price. Must wait first sometimes, because it's very crowd. The service also good and fast, I really love to be here. But I feel uncomfortable with the  smells.
unique, delicious food and great place
Reminten with cafe ambiance... They wrote this resto with self services... But,  the SOP (procedures)  not ready for self services.  So,  there a loooooonggg way to go to take meal and pay the bill.. Sometime,  meal that not ready will be delivery by waiter. But. Its take a looooongggggg time to wait.  And waiter sometime so. Confuse what meal that not already delivered.... Until we finish other meal (1 hour),  few meal not delivered to us actually...  For meal,  the twste was so so...  They have a strong taste... Maybe not fit for children under 3 years old.
New place and delicious taste, worth to try
The best place for your hangout
If you are a foreigner tourist, this is a must to visit place. It serves variety of local Yogyakarta and Indonesian food with good hygiene. So no worry about food poisoning while exploring local taste.
The must added place to visit if you are come to Yogyakarta, the food is good and the place gives the essence of yogyakarta culture. The food also is traditional and can match everyone taste ( i think ) haha
Prices are amazing and food was just as great. Def do not miss, as other commenters mentioned it is a great experience. Great variety on the menu. Place was very busy every night we went.
A unique restaurant in Yogyakarta founded by an eccentric guy / lady (genderqueer) called Raminten. It's indeed very unique because it's quite mystical with an antique royal chariot of Raminten but also it has a quirky sense of humor when it comes to food serving. When I went there I was served coconut ice inside a large bown that looked more like an aquarium. Hahaha.
People use to go here while waiting for The House of Raminten. This place was a place where the parents usually waiting for their kids (there's a lot of schools near the place) or having a social gathering. They have what we call as millenials food or hype food such as "smashed chicken" and other home food like "sour soup" that they don't sold in The House of Raminten. You do the self service here. They serve your food at the cashier, then you have to take it yourself, then clean up the mess at the place that have been reserved for clean up. A good way to teach self respect and respect to others.
Cozy place.....u can choose traditional drink at here.... the name of foods and drink is unique n funny.... u can listen "gamelan" sound as background music....sometime you can  also see woman who paint "batik" in here.... smell of flowers (i think its "menyan") surrounding the resto... i tried "ayam koteka", mendoan, and ice kunir asam....
Dood was AMAZING. Cheap price for Urban people. 24 hours open. Limited parking space. Better drop off only.
One of the most popular restaurant in Yogyakarta. It offers wide variations of local cuisines such as tahu telor and bistik. Surprisingly, the price is affordable and could be consideres as cheap.
Etnics Place for Hangout......, very crowded and waiting list for order
Great place. It's kinda have a mythycal feeling when you enter the place. Great decoration. As for the drinks it's too sweetfor me. So if you are a sweet lover. This might be a place for you.
The place is good,can be a choice if the raminten restaurant is full and packed. The service system in the restaurant is a self-service system, so you order and you pay directly and place the plates by yourself. Though the food choice is not as many as the main restaurant of raminten but so far it is good
biasane nang daerahku, ngombe jumbo iku porsine gelas gedhe, tapi nang kene porsi jumbo iku isok digawe wong limo. hahahaha. pasti nek nang jogja mampir mrene maneh. seneng ambu menyan e. wkwkwkwk.
Ristorante con cibo indonesiano, economico e particolare. Forse un po' scomodo per gli occidentali perché gran parte dei tavoli non ha sedie e ci si deve sedere per terra
I have came here several times, the most unpredictable and unique of Jogja.  You will see a combination of many things here, mystics, horor, fun, improper and crazy  When you entering this place, first thing weird is the smell of incense  then you will see many bowl shaped banana leaves containing flower  as offering to ancestors and an old woman sit down on the floor, making fire to burn some frankincense.  All of the thing is to make the feel of this place even more mysterious and horor.
Not satisfied at all. Timing from the order until the food serves on table take 2.5hours and the food are cold. Supposed that their need to refresh their time management to prooving their service.
Great place...great food...affordable price
My wife got bitten by bugs in the upper floor
nice place to eat java traditional food. but low respon
Photogenic restaurant with tasty food
A uniquely-designed restaurant, accentuated with Javanese style. The staff is clothed in Javanese style, too. The foods and drinks are so-so. The place is a bit creepy with some incense smell, I guess..
Raminten kitchen is a good place for hangout drink coffee or food, they have a outdoor place is really cozy for chill. The menu is good and so many traditional food and drink
Reasonable price with big portio. Avoid the queu by reserving a table in advance if there are more than 2 guests. Quick service and friendly staffs.
Bon restaurant avec une ambiance très agréable et un service attentionné. Attention, paiement en espèces uniquement, et prévoir une attente de 15/20 minutes avant de pouvoir s’installer.
Always crowded. Strangely interesting vibe, fascinating decoration. All the staff here are friendly. All you need to do to be able to survive to enjoy this place is by being patient.
Nice place, nice food and best for price :)
Ayam Kremes was an incredible meal. It was oozing with lemon grass flavor. Just wished they served faster here; i waited for a long time in the queue.
Great Indonesian food! Loved to go here! Later in the evening it can get very busy, so it is best to go early!
24 hours restaurant with good menu! Love it!
This restaurant is good for backpacker cheap price good place and beautiful waitress
rasa standar , pelanyanan lamaaaaaaaaaaaaa bangeeeeet...pesen nasi goreng aja nunggu 1 jam lebih .. hadeuh
- Need improvement in coordination of serving the food. - "Tempe Garit" - better to use "local hand made tempe" (wrapped in banana leaf).
One stop shopping center for every tourists coming to buy souvenirs in Yogya. Located in jl Malioboro, almost every items here are the same as the kiosks we sees in every corner of the street with reasonable price. And the atmosphere of Royal Palace will greets us from the entrance door.
Tempate penak nggo nongkrong, ono kandang manuk & jaran sak isine. Panganane enak tp wedange rodo larang. Betewe mangut lelene endes.. 😁
We have to wait for so long, tooks 1 hour in waiting list, and another hour for the food 😔
This place actually feels slightly the same like it main restaurant, house of raminten. It has the same atmosphere, cozy place cheap meals. Overall I think it was a good lunch experience .
Tasty javanese food, excelent java culture atmosphere and service, reassonable price, also has a good standard protocol for preventing pandemic.
Taste of foods quite good, no queue when I visit, no wait long time for food and drink.
My recomendation are this resto very good for international tourist. Java aromatic, 24 hour nonstop, and traditional menu. The location near from center of town, so be completefull. + varieted menu - parking so crowded
one of the most iconic restaurant in Jogjakarta , and you will find some **weird** menu , but its good , but the taste just so so , my faf is Mendoan and Ayam Koteka , must try....
Best cuisine, my favorite is sweet  Jackfruit a. K. A GUDEG
Sooooo cheap and 24 hours! Wow! Also, their desserts are crazy one, jawdropper portion! Soooo big laaaa! They have horses too, just ask direction to the restroom to witness it.
The location across to Stella Duce High School, near with old Raminten resto. They provide food and beverages. Traditional beverages are available here such as : Kunyit Asam, Beras Kencur ect
Cozy place to gather with your friends. You can feel the Javanese atmosphere here. Food price affordable, the taste also ok.
Find a simple food and you can see horse here, good for student because the price are acceptable, but if you eat on the 2nd floor you can smelt the horse.... Ups dont forget to clean your table by yourself
Unique restaurant with plain food. If u have a tight schedule, this place is not recommended. Been waiting quite long to be seated, and more wait to order n food to come out
Good taste of fried chicken, a very spicy ayam geprek. Good taste. But the aircond seems not affect us at all
Good place to hangout, pretty strategic place, gets crowded on weekends especially night time, price for food and drinks are affordable, but food tastes basic, space wise it's big enough, smoking and non smoking are available
Nice place to relax, with an economic price
One of the unique restaurant in Yogyakarta owned by Hamzah Sulaeman, the owner of famed Mirota and Hamzah Batik. The price of food and beverages in The House of Raminten was cheap, for the serving,  you have to wait for a while  if you come here on the weekend or on the holiday.
Nice place to eat and meet up
For people that love traditional place with unique art of yogyakarta's, u can visit here and also u can have meal with best choice. Good price good service!
Not many breakfast options but what we had was very tasty. The soundtrack was a bit unsettling.
Quick service, yet the staffs need to be more friendly, the foods' taste just so - so, but their food plating is unique. They also served good beverages to try
Comfort place, good food
What I ate was very delicious!  The service was friendly, nice, but not enough for 5 * !
Good Place !! Ada tempat mbatik nya dan ada stable horse nya jugaaa ❤ tempat murah dan enak buat kumpul2 dan makan bersama kelurga ⚡
Cozy place to hangout and chill. The menu is bit pricy, especially the beverages menu. Live music available during night time
Do not come here during weekend, lunch time and dinner time so crowded and you will waiting list. Price cheap with variant menu of traditional food.
Raminten Kitchen is an extension of the House of Raminten. Its targeted guests are younger people such as university students and thus, their menu is simpler (ayam penyet and the like). The place is instagramable and suitable for a get together
Unlike no other places in Yogyakarta, This place offers a lot of unique menu, from traditional to modern with a twist that makes you want to try it all..
This place has traditional ethnic concept. Very good for tourism. But it maybe uncomfortable for moslem or somepoeple because smells of 'Kemenyan'
24 hours restaurant or warung in Bahasa. They serve various local food and beverage, also with unique ambience. Prepare yourself for queing in the weekend or public holiday.
A great scented restaurant with some best choices of traditional menu. But please take note that the queue for a table sometimes will be around a half to an hour.
A unique restaurant with "sesajen" everywhere. Price are cheap for a generous serving size. Hard to find a parking place, you have to park on the side of the road.
Best place,  best food,  and best services in yogyakarta,  but not recommended if you want to visit in the daytime because the weather too hot and don't have air conditioner.
This place is totally served overpriced food. Food that you can buy in smaller restaurants and I believe it will taste better as well. The food is not so nice and the service is worse. Not recommended
Taste average, lots of order forgotten by waitress...at 9 pm most of the menu are sold out
Best wedangan in town🫶🏻
Such a good place to visit
You should try "Ayam Geprek". The chicken really have a great quality, add it with cabe or chilli as many as you can take, and it will be a hot food, because the quality of the chillis are also good
It's a nice place to eat the authentic cousin, but if you need more restaurant' atmosphere, then you'd better go to The House of Raminten.
Suitable for normal chit-chat with friends (more than two people is preferred). Special for its slow service, which allows visitor to enjoy the chatter.
Unique and affordable restaurant. Has a lot of different kind of menu. Usually too crowded so we have to wait until we got seat.
Is there a 0 star option???? It is Pathetic that a customer has to wait 2 hours for food to arrive and once it has arrived it was returned twice because it was ICE COLD!!!! How can food take that long and be served as though it just came out of the freezer!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!!
They have quite a lot of food options and the food is delicious. The price is also so cheap, but sometimes we have to wait before we get seated because it's usually crowded.
Food is ok. Some Drinks are too sweet. Prepare to wait as they can be crowded especially during meal time.
Always crowded but a good place to eat
A lot of options in the menu, good services and fast response, most important its cheap, worth for backpackers pocket, but little bit unhygienic, there's dust in few place, overall raminten its wort to eat
Nice food and nice price
Pyszne jedzenie i wspaniały klimat
My go-to everytime I'm back home. Artsy and comfy place, staff ramah, pelayanan cepet, makanan enak, murah pulak ❤
Good food with affordable price. They sell traditional food with modern way in serving. This place is a great choice for young tourists.
Nice place comes with traditional comfort food
Makanan cukup enak, nasi boleh ambil sepuasnya tapi hanya boleh sekali, minum boleh Refill
Food taste is standar, but nice service. The employees are friendly. Oh and we'll learn abt self service there.
The food is good. A good amount for portion and the price was pretty afdordable too. The service was quite unpleasant and the I waited too long.
Love the breeze from 2nd floor, especially before sunset. Good vibes and service was fine.
The cakes are vary from traditional cake (klepon, lemper, arem-arem) to western cake. The meals are also very nice: oxtail soup, buntil, oseng pare, kikil, etc.
coffee and food is delicious. many people favourite this place, and I do. try when you are in Jogja
There is a horse stable right in the back, beside kitchen. If you lucky, you can smell the horse excretion while you eating, giving a new sensation to your food.
Unique n cozy place. Many local n foreign tourist come here. They serve good food with a friendly price. Niceeee
Traditional and klenik ambiance resto, Very strong "dupa" or kemenyan aroma here, Traditional Food and beverages is delicious Very crowded, 24 Hours service
Very crowded as always, except after 1 AM. Think the food tastes better now. A unique magical atmosphere.
cozy, traditional, comfort, nice service, litteraly nice place to hang out with your friend. the food is good and very cheap.
It's a unique and comfy place. They offer some menu with relatively low price and good taste. Highly recommended!
So thematic. Really like this place. The choice of food is quite a lot, tasty and cheap! The waiter is also friendly.
Tried this since it's on top of the list of must try resto in Jogja, but the wait was super too long. Quite popular among the local travellers.
Permanently close?  When? A week ago I was there for dinner. Although queueing I still enjoy here. Good services and delicious food ...
The one around Kotabaru is the best.Long line for seats to be available.Friendly staff..and great local javanese cuisine with big portion and reasonable price.
This is a different segment of Raminten. Aim the teenagee because it only sell ayam geprek that become favourite for teen. Also we can add vegetables. Secont storey more recommended.
Uniqe place to taste traditional food with javanese culture touch. The menu option are extra and the price affordable
Affordable 5-30k food and beverages
It’s nice I was here visiting with my office mate. I ordered chicken “Koteka” and hot ginger with milk, the taste is good.
Decent food. Nasi goreng was exactly what I needed after a flight! No aircon so it was very hot!
fantastic food.. must try !!
The waiting list is sooo long. Better not to come at the peak hours to avoid the crowd. The food taste is just average.
Maksi...geprek ...penyet...satu saudara
Everything in the menu taste super yummy and super cheap. The place is very convenient and open for 24 hours. Very very recommended
A unique and nice place.. Cool decoration..the food is also nice.. I like the egg inside the bamboo (forgot the name)
Although it's not a wide place, it's comfortable. I love the fragrance around it. For food price, it's not cheap and not expensive. Just right in the middle.
Very cozy place but hopefully they put the fan on the 2nd floor because it's too hot in the day
Unique place but still cozy. And most important is the price is cheap but comes with extra size and delicious food
Good food with reasonable place, nice place, restaurant with unique concept, usually crowded so there is a waiting room in front of the restaurant.
Delicious and cheap food. The place so artistics, but too many statues. Awkward smells and praying stuff
Unique place, good menu the portion of your meal is affordable with the price. At the night you must be passion for get the table.
Free Wi-Fi, cozy place
Famous restaurant with delicious food. You must patiently waiting for it because this restaurant Always full of customer. Great service and this restaurant is cozy.
Good food, good ambience, excellent service!☺️
Nice place, plenty choice of food with very reasonable price. But the place is really full on weekend nite, be prepared to be in the waiting list.
It's 24 hours. Serve good food and friendly price. And ... they have horses at the back. Cute! ❤
This place isnt too crowded like the other raminten place, but the menu isn't as complete as the other place. It's a nice place to hang.
Really really good and nice place to try autentic enu of Java with modern style presentation. Nice place. Nice situation&condition. Good people and good taste. Really recomended. . .! ! !
nasty toilets, dirty floors, horses kept next to kitchen. very poor hygiene.  not worth the hype.
Tasty food with cheap price but avoid to visit in saturday night, you will find long waiting list.
+ Authentic Indonesian fusion food.  Wide variety.  Decent pricing.  Efficient queuing system.  - Crowded.
Enak wareg ngono waeh
You can buy traditional java food in here like gudeg and the price is in budget list the place is cozy for relax and chill out
The place has good ambiance and the food is good but the service a bit slow.
Great atmosphere.. The food is just as boring and tasteless.... Meat is not tender..
Beautiful jogja culture, with comfortable jogja traditional music. Best dessert for grilled ice cream and fried ice cream.
The interrior is very traditional and unique. The price was incredibly cheap. And.. oh.. they have real horse on the back kitchen.
Cozy place and with reasonable price, but we can't do reservation here. The waiting list is long that we can wait til 2-3 hours
Cheap, 24 hours, good food, good drinks. Sadly its quite small so you might not get seats
Delicious food with reasonable price. I'd love to visit this place again with my friends or family
Famous restaurant in Yogyakarta, the food is relatively good, the services average, you need to patient when ordering or call waiter
The price is very cheap and the food was not bad. Expect to be on the waiting list since this place is on hype right now.
If you're looking for a traditional dish with high-end price this is the place to go.  The food was okay.
The seating area was very nice but the food was not very good. Service was below par and the bathroom was a disaster.
Its about the place unique vibrant eclectic javanese vibe. A place to enjoy service and a touch of rainbow to brighten Yogya days :)
A glimpse of javanese food history
cozzyyyy bangeettt?!! superr worthh itt !!
Atmosphere is cool They had NO fresh food at all. Food not sp nice Cheap
Nice place to eat. Quite cheap and taste good. The staffs are also friendly.
enak buat makan lewat tengah malam
Interesting place, witty name of the dishes that taste so-so. Good experiece overall
Nice place, noce foods, worthy prices. The only problem is there wasnt parking lots for the car, so be prepared for parking at the roadside
Just don't go to the bathroom. You will pass the horse stables. Yes. Horse stables, right  ecxt to the kitchen  and where the dishes or washed.
Great food. Lele was especially great. Enjoyed a good evening here with friends.
Cheap and good food. You have to pay cash first during the order. Smoking allowed inside.
Such a unique concept of a restaurant. The food was good. The beverages was also good. The ambience was great.
Angklung live music was so not enjoyable.... Food was OK and taste good. Price was cheap
Well it's great place to hangout, but i don't really like the fried rice.
Always having a good meal with reasonable price. And of course traditional ambiance is so relaxing.
Makanan oke. cm agak lama dtg nya..
You have to wait pretty long for your foods to be served when it's crowded, and the queue for tables is pretty long around prime time whole week, and almost all day on weekend.
the place was super dirty, I saw a huge rat playing around and some cocroach freely going in and out the kitchen with nobody cares, the food was not good and the waitresses are mean
This is a new place, established about 9 months ago. Good, self service, good place, clean toilet, and has 2 horses at the yard.
The food is good and the place very interesting.
It's my first time visiting Raminten's Kitchen.. It's a good place to hangout with your friends...
Nice place to eat traditional food with traditional decoration. Food also delicious with inexpensive price. Very reccomended
Tempat makan ramai. Makanan murah enak.  Suasana jogja..
Great location. Nice ambience. But many times needed to queu for long just to stay here.
Guttttt bgt pokona mah
Pretty good vibe,and the food is mesmerizing. Dont worry about the price,it only took 3$ to make ur tummy pretty full
Accidentally came here with my friends. The place is near The House of Raminten. But I really love the food! The price is OK.
Bad service, food taste terrible. Not worthed to visit although price is very cheap
Unique place to enjoy your meal
Well everything was good

If you came in holiday season, you have to waiting. The good things is they provide chair. the food is so-so.
The place is nice, but the food is not really good. They have good dessert.
Love this place and the atmosphere and the waiters. The food is good also. The best in Jogja
Neatly-organized service with varieties of affordable meals. This place is crowded during weekends
Hmmm.... Semuanya bagus... Tp anak sy tdk suka dan ketakutan... "ayh... Hantunya byk"
Pricey place for traditional food. The environment isn't as engaging as the usual raminten.
The food not very delicious and the food is not varied...if compared to the house of raminten...but the price is not so pricy
great food, don't expect them to speak english though. But they have a menu and are very helpful
24 hours ready for served food. I really like it's nasi kucing. so delicious
Unique place to take a dinner or lunch, but usually very crowded on here so you must take a waiting list first. I think you must get a reservation first
A bit of a strange experience: People queuing, bustling inside, property in need of TLC, decent food if not particularly memorable.
LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here the only issue I have is that they have so many good options you end up ordering everything!
Rasanya dan harganya belum tahu seperti apa. Pas kesini waiting list
It is a good place to feel the nuance of Javanese cultures and taste various food with unique name but tasty
Nice place for hanging out! restaurant with javanesse concept. Cozy and good services. Wifi available.
i'm little surprised when i saw the price. they're cheaper than i thought. but yeah its suit with the taste.
U may have a nice timing to visit this place... Full of visitor and never ending pleasure with delicious and unique food
Nice traditional Javanese ambience for hanging out with group. The foods and beverages are served in big portion
too crowded and waiting too long just for unconsistence food taste, all protein are (chicken) served cold

Long enough to wait but the food is quite varied, delicious and affordable price

Unique place to eat, i arrived at raminten at dinner time, it was a long waiting line. The food was so so but cheap.
Unique place to eat with traditional ambience. Provide various kind of food with affordable price.
Variety of foods are good, but the taste just okay. Too crowded and a bit dark
Like this place cause it has a cheap and delicious food.... Remember, on weekends is always crowded visitors..
Place is super cool with Javanese setting, meals are so so though, a bit pricey too
I haven't actually gone in, but this place is truly unique. And the food is good and rather cheap.
Looooongggggg queue. Even you should wait for a long time again after you order your food. Pricey and the taste is so so. Not worth it.
Best place to eat and hang out with friends.. Traditional looks that present you how cool restaurant can be
Nice foods more of sea foods .Very tasty in a nice environment .Service is good and having a very helpful staff ..Smoking in side the restaurant is a problem .
Food was decent, queue was orderly. Went here on the weekend, very crowded and the food waiting time could be quicker.
Expensive.  If you like things branded go there. But if you like the taste of the food you just waste your money.
They changed so much. Renovating lost a lot of uniqueness. Going there years ago I was disappointed with the change.
When great food and entertainment collaboration in one entertainment
The menu are vary, the price is so cheap and the taste is good. Easy to get here.
Nice ambience, great food, unique concept. Not recommended to visit when it's crowded

Good ambience you will get from this place. Price was cheap. You will got queue, that's the point.

A good restaurant and a school of patience as well. Don't you think that delicious food need compensated by an extra wait?
Nice place to eat, hang out, with low food prices but you have to wait a bit to get the table since there is waiting list
the place is usually crowded during holiday time. regardless, it serves delicious and unique food and beverages.
