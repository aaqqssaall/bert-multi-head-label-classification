review
Tempat makan yang Unik, dengan menu cukup bagus dan harga bersahabat buat wisatawan domestik.
Biasanya kesini cuma anterin temen dari luar kota. Yang bikin males antrinya kalo holiday season. Padahal makanannya biasa saja.
Siap-siap antri lama dan menunggu pesanan makanan yang cukup lama. Tapi cita rasa makanannya memang enak.
Murah meriah dan iconic kota jogja banget. Tapi untuk rasa biasa aja sih hehe. Siap2 antri kalo kesini
affordable price. menu nya cukup banyak. tempat nya cukup cozy. kandang kuda nya cukup mengganggu.
Entah kenapa kalau masuk kesini berasa horor aja, mungkin bau bau rempah dan dupa yang membuat suasana jadi agak mistis.. 😅
Murah dan penuh budaya. Tp kurang nyaman sama bau nya. Dan tempat cuci piringnya deket kandang kuda.
Ndak suka suasananya. Terlalu magis. Makananannya pun bisa dibilang nggak enak hmmm
Suka bbrp menu makan nya, tp tdk suka dg suasanya & konsep resto nya
Hari minggu kemaren pesen minuman markisa disini, tenggorokannya langsung gatel dan batuk😏
Rame sangaaat. Volume musik ikut volume suara pengunjung. Makin rame pengunjung makin kenceng musiknya. Self service
Penyajiannya lumayan lama Rasa masakannya enak Tempatnya nyaman
Penggemar ayam monggo silahkan datang ke sini. Parkir luas dan buka 24 jam.
Biasa aja rasa makanannya. Lebih ke jual suasana jawa aja. Harga juga agak mahal.
Suasananya perlu diimprove. Apalagi kebersihannya. Taste so so. Gudeg komplit terrible taste.
Ga suka sama suasananya, terlalu klenik... Tp makananny lumayan enak
Makanan enak Tp tmpat mkn smpit Hrs nunggu dpt meja mkan
Suasana nya jogja abiss... Porsi super jumboo... Pelayananya ramah n cepat jg..
Tempat e enak, cuma harganya kurang bersahabat bagi mahasiswa
Makanannya biasa aja, bau menyannya dimana mana.  Tempat sholatnya bau eek burung, ga nyaman.
Bau menyan wkwk makanan enak dan unik,  tapi baunya,  yg gak kuat menyan klenik klenik bakal pusing makan disini.
Mungkin ACnya bisa dibenahi agar terasa lebih dingin dan sejuk tidak panas. Selebihnya oke
Tempatnya mudah dijangkau, harga jg terjangkau, kualitas makanan sesuai harga
Harus sabar ngantri...menu minuman yg sangat menggoda selera
Khasnya jogja ada disini, datang pas jam makan malam bisa ngantri lama.
Makanannya enak, tp sy kurang suka bau dupa 😳
Makanan tidak panas. Dideket dapur dan kamar mandi ada kuda 3 ekor.
Porsi super besar cocok kalau untuk makan bersama Suasana Jawa kental
Dari semua aku cuma suka minuman dlm frezeernya yaitu green tea dan thai tea
Hidangan disini tergolong murah dengan menu yang beragam. Ruangan didesain gaya Jawa dan diiringi lagu bertemakan sama.
Murah...enak dan sederhana
Rumah makan yg super antri di jogja
Gudegnya enak, tempatnya enak. Sayang terdapat kuda di dapur.. tidak sehat
makanan nya biasa aja gk istimewa dan hrg mahal
Masakannya tdk begitu nikmat, tempatnya memang rada sempit
Tempatnya unik tapi makanan biasa aja, kurang enak.
makan bisa diambil sesukanya, tapi standard pilihan dan porsi tdk jelas
Porsi gede. Di dalam ada kuda-nya, bikin ga nyaman.
makanannya murah, rasa lumayan. ngantri untuk dapet tempat
Selalu waiting list kalo kesini. Dan waiting listnya ga sebentar.
Biasa aja...  Hehe.  Aneh, makanan cmpur bau dupa. Eneg di perut.
Antreee nya panjang terutama prime time jam 19 sd 22
Rasa biasa saja nggak istimewa. Hanya penyajiannya yg terasa lain.
makananya enak harga terjangkau pemandangan unik
Rasa masakan biasa saja dan tempatnya agak2 angker 😀
Nuansa jogja sangat terasa, lama antri..makanan standar
Suasana kraton. Gtu..... enak bwt ngbrol...yg penting...bkin ktghan trus,,,
Antrinya terlalu lama, masakan biasa aja tapi ikonik
Aku mau tanya, Raminten itu laki apa cewe c? Gambarnya bikin saya bingung..
Unik dengan suasana Jawa yang kental.
Ngantri kaya bagi sembako, harga murah kebersihan tidak dijamin
Lokasi strategis, enak utk ngobrol tapi agak pricey
Antre lama, rasa makanan sedang, menu banyak, harga sedang
Jangan dateng saat liburan. Penuh banget
menunya biasa, harga agak tinggi
Makanan kurang.  Tempat okelah
Enak raminten yg lama yg antri bnyak itu
Enak tapi bau menyan/dupa
porsinya kurang banyak :)
Lumayan mantap
Terlalu ramai
Antri lamaaaaa
价格不算便宜，人均消费高于市场价，主要是为服务和环境买单。  🍚炒饭味道不错，牛肉和沙爹腌制入味，虾片有点干硬。 🥤椰汁饮料太甜了，虽然很大一杯，但是椰果各种小料特别多，喝完糖份摄入超标头昏脑胀。  用餐环境很棒，服务人员脚上铃铛声很可爱，旁边在装修有点吵闹，其他都不错，适合来印尼旅行体验民族特色，或者朋友下午茶聊天的地方。
it was aight but i think it's a bit overpriced for something that taste quite normal, some too sour some too sweet and some too spicy no balance at the food, but the ice bakar was aight. maybe because of the big portion that makes it expensive but come on the protein was so little and even the tempe was taste a bit old😔
The food here probably the best Javanese food in Yogya but I think they desert 3 stars because it lack of service due to over load of customer, what ever I wanted to order, the restaurant sold out. For instance sate of all kinds were sold out and a few more other items as well. We were there around 730pm. Price of most items are very reasonable. The staff who took our order did not help us much in controlling the quantity that we ordered and we ended up with so many dishes. Food were not  brought to us all at once and my Indonesian friends had to wait because they said that in their culture they want all the food come to the table before they can eat. The food were just ok, however, I still recommend everyone to come here at least once while visiting Yogya because there aren't that many upscale resto in this town. The ambiance and atmosphere are awesome here.   Have a great time in Yogya!
So so. I don't think they have special food. Free wifi and give a thumb up for the 24h open. It seems difficult to choose the seat by yourself because the place is always crowded. You have to wait for the free seat.
the place was semi outdoor, and it was a really bright day. the service was just decent but it took me almost an hour to get my order ready
Unique concept and always crowded. Many variant food menu, meal with standard taste and reasonable price.
The price is twice as high compared to The House of Raminten which is just a 5 min walk away.  Many house flies too. Only advantage is that it is less crowded and you can use a credit card for payment
The concept is to offer many real local dishes, but no healthy meals anymore - the famous steak on stone is gone. It is true they often forget your order or do not inform you if it is sold out. No beer.
They create traditional atmosphere will gamelan music, "dupa", lesehan. Very affordable price, open 24 hours, good option for travellers.
The food is amazing except for the fact that the waiting for the food itself was 2 hours long. Seriously it was so long but the food should've been easier to serve and cook. If you want to visit this place just visit The House of Raminten.
Average food good service a bit pricey
The place is unique. The owner has created the restaurant with nuance of magic, the scent of  jasmine is everywhere. It is an open space restaurant. I think it used to be a front yard or terrace of a big house. When visited this place we were on school holiday. It was so crowded. We have to wait and a lady take note of guest on waiting list. Then we waited for about an hour for dinner. The food was not so good. It was cold. But the price was cheap. One note about this place that attrack people is the uniqueness. But not with the food.
Very long queue so dont go there on empty stomach. We waited like 1 hour to get a table for 6 people. Price is very reasonable. Food is just average although they have funny cheeky name. Dessert on the otherhand is very good especially if you like traditional Indonesian dessert. Open 24 hours so they claimed but several items we want to ordered are out of stock. Parking is difficult so prefer to get there by Grab car.
I was dining alone last night. It wasn't a great experience since most people dining with friends or family. They're not providing a single traveller sitting and dining alone apparently. So I got to sit on a seat set of four. This joint selling something more to cultural setting than the great food, not to mention the horse stall in the back right to the kitchen etc, for some people it's not they cup of tea. Not too bad though.
The restaurant is pretty nice with javanese ornaments but the food is a bit pricey
This place decoration and ambience is very unique. The waiter and waitress uniform is unusual. The foods and drinks are not to special, but you cannot find it in any other places. The price is standard. At least you have to visit once when visit Yogyakarta.
The concept is unique. Btw you can see and take photos with horse, here.
When I see the crowd queueing for table, I expect to have a good food for dinner. After about 20 minutes queue, we were directed to the table.  Ordering menu was fun, the attendant was helpful and payment was directly with the attendant. Very sistematic and hassle free.  Portion of the foods and beverages were big for the price. Taste was plain, below my expectation.  Environment was cozy and unique, with traditional Javanese style here and there. There were several horses near the toilet. Statue of the owner was also unique.  Verdict: Good place, not so good food.
One of many tourist objects in Jogjakarta. Prices here are cheap compared to other big named restaurant. If you go to here at peak hour, be ready to wait a bit long to get your seat. For the foods, for me it is not as delicious as I expected. Atmosphere is a bit creepy for me.
swasana nyaman, staff nya okei n ramah
Actually ate here 3 times during my stay in jogja, cos of the reasonable pricing and it was rather easy for a tourist like me to order as there's pictures in the menu to order. Down side was the popular stuffs like a garang asem is always sold out.  Most stuffs are good but the fried chicken tend to be a bit too tough and some of the drinks are either too sweet or diluted (juice).  Expect to queue if you're here during peak hours.
This place offers an Amazing food, and also a comfortable and cozy place, very close to other popular areas such as malioboro, this place is rather popular making it a prime option for other traveller searching for food.  Expect delays, because when you ordering food you need to enter a line system making it feel like a waste when you eating alone, but in group this place offers a very good option.  Try to go to this area not in holidays, and weekends because going in that time likely result in you going to starve because of the long line and crowded place.
Order only to waitress girl, you should pay right away. Waitress guy served the food and take the empty plates. There are only 3 waitress girls, be patient until they are taking orders from other table. The girl waitress sometimes is not focus and made mistakes. Please ask her to recite oder list.  Mostly the food is alright. Nothing special. But, the atmosphere is very javanese.
Was already expecting average food and variations of desert and beverages, and somewhat unique ambiance.. Sat outside, I can smell toes..  Nasi goreng below expectasion, wife thinks it's quite nice. Telur bakar is omelette with soy sauce and sambal terasi, meh! Nasi bakar, rawon, rica-rica was out.. Pepes tuna is okay.  Desert and beverages are okay, but still nothing special. Service is nice and fast. We sat outside, and it smells like toe!
I waited for about an hour just to enter the restaurant.. and i waited for another hour for the foods that are not that great. A little disappointing. But the good thing is that they have this waiting area with a tv and some chairs. The prices for the foods are cheap. The waitresses use a traditional clothing.
Nek suasana é menyenangkan njawani tapi wayah mêtu panganan kok njelehi opo maneh rasaning panganan soto bathok nganggo sendok kayu malah mambu kayu lawas
The place may be so artistic and unique with traditional Javanese design, the foods are also at affordable price. Unfortunately, the food taste was so so 😐 (chicken in the Gudeg was hard to chew), as well as the beverage.
Overall was good. The food, the place, the decoration was unique. But the smells, nope i don't like it. And almost forgot, the waiters just so beautiful 😂
Good ambience to eat javanese food..
Like a mysitic restaurant, you will find "dupa" and "menyan" scent there..
So so food, with so so price. Rp16K (1.5 USD) for a meal with rice and chicken and tamarind soup (sayur asem). The room is air-conditioned, they cook there, and seemingly there's no exhaust fan, or not enough if there's any at all. So sometimes, when there's a lot of cooking in there, there'll be a lot of smoke too. And spicy smoke triggers a lot of sneezings. So you go upstair, where you can sit in an open air place and smell the fresh air, no smoke, but you can also smell whatever the smell of horse pen next to the restaurant. But at least you have a choice, horse pen or spicy smoke.  Tips, do not buy the botled sweet tea from the fridge which cost you 10K, but ask for ice tea for 5K, and get free refill.  And when I ate there, the music were evergreen oldies, and not gamelan. "Why can't we be like storybook children....?"
A place which sells 'ayam geprek' and 'sayur lodeh' in modern level :) You can find their menus in street stalls around Jogja with more reasonable prices and taste though. But... I really appreciate the effort to educate the costumers to service themselves after eating; to put the dishes to the sink and throw off the trashes (tissues, banana leaves, bottles) by themselves. Unfortunately, not all the costumers aware of it and leave the dishes and trashes on the table.
Serving time was bad. 50% of first ordered food had to be cancelled and changed (after 15-20 minutes wait) due to “sold-out”. Taste was average.
A unique restaurant in Yogyakarta founded by an eccentric guy / lady (genderqueer) called Raminten. It's indeed very unique because it's quite mystical with an antique royal chariot of Raminten but also it has a quirky sense of humor when it comes to food serving. When I went there I was served coconut ice inside a large bown that looked more like an aquarium. Hahaha.
My wife got bitten by bugs in the upper floor
The location across to Stella Duce High School, near with old Raminten resto. They provide food and beverages. Traditional beverages are available here such as : Kunyit Asam, Beras Kencur ect
Unique restaurant with plain food. If u have a tight schedule, this place is not recommended. Been waiting quite long to be seated, and more wait to order n food to come out
Quick service, yet the staffs need to be more friendly, the foods' taste just so - so, but their food plating is unique. They also served good beverages to try
Taste average, lots of order forgotten by waitress...at 9 pm most of the menu are sold out
It's a nice place to eat the authentic cousin, but if you need more restaurant' atmosphere, then you'd better go to The House of Raminten.
Permanently close?  When? A week ago I was there for dinner. Although queueing I still enjoy here. Good services and delicious food ...
Decent food. Nasi goreng was exactly what I needed after a flight! No aircon so it was very hot!
The waiting list is sooo long. Better not to come at the peak hours to avoid the crowd. The food taste is just average.
Delicious and cheap food. The place so artistics, but too many statues. Awkward smells and praying stuff
Cozy place and with reasonable price, but we can't do reservation here. The waiting list is long that we can wait til 2-3 hours
Famous restaurant in Yogyakarta, the food is relatively good, the services average, you need to patient when ordering or call waiter
The price is very cheap and the food was not bad. Expect to be on the waiting list since this place is on hype right now.
If you're looking for a traditional dish with high-end price this is the place to go.  The food was okay.
Atmosphere is cool They had NO fresh food at all. Food not sp nice Cheap
You have to wait pretty long for your foods to be served when it's crowded, and the queue for tables is pretty long around prime time whole week, and almost all day on weekend.
The food is good and the place very interesting.
這裡的特色是同性的男侍應生，食物沒有很大的特色，價錢高份量少。
first time, but its a nice place to relax, its has a special chair  for enjoying  food, softdrink, etc.
If you came in holiday season, you have to waiting. The good things is they provide chair. the food is so-so.
Pricey place for traditional food. The environment isn't as engaging as the usual raminten.
The food not very delicious and the food is not varied...if compared to the house of raminten...but the price is not so pricy
Unique place to take a dinner or lunch, but usually very crowded on here so you must take a waiting list first. I think you must get a reservation first
A bit of a strange experience: People queuing, bustling inside, property in need of TLC, decent food if not particularly memorable.
Unique place to eat, i arrived at raminten at dinner time, it was a long waiting line. The food was so so but cheap.
Variety of foods are good, but the taste just okay. Too crowded and a bit dark
Nice foods more of sea foods .Very tasty in a nice environment .Service is good and having a very helpful staff ..Smoking in side the restaurant is a problem .
They changed so much. Renovating lost a lot of uniqueness. Going there years ago I was disappointed with the change.
Nice ambience, great food, unique concept. Not recommended to visit when it's crowded
The food is so so... But the place is nice.. Self service concept.. return the tray to the box yow...
Great place great food, reasonable price, just wish they have air conditioner
Not the real raminten Neither Amrican Fast food resto. No vegetable other than sayur asem that taste sweet ! Oooooo may...my...
Despite of the authenticity, cheap price and, atmosphere, the food was in okay level.
The interior is quite pleasing, but too bad they only sell fried chicken, I taught it was a new and revamped raminten  the first time I went there
A bit overrated. Come here if u want to try every type of javanese food in one restaurant
Good ambience, good service, but the food is overrated and the music is too loud
This place is comfortable, but dont come at Saturday night because so crowded.
Makanannya laamaaaaaa banget dtgnya
Great for tourist looking for experience. Not recommended for locals or good food hunter
affordable price, comfortable place with "kemben-style"-waitress. highly recommended!
Ramai banget, padahal pengen banget nyicip makanannya tapi antriiii 😩
Nothing special, just unique place to take dinner with traditional menus of java
Their take out preps took ages which made me smoke my whole cigarette while waiting my order.
If you want to come in the morning, you will not get the warm food except ayam ingkung
Good at interiors and Javanese theme , but the taste of food not too good
Good atmosphere, but serving time was little bit long
Tempat makan yang berkesan dan menarik untuk dikunjungi
Surprisingly mediocre food with all the hype. Service was slow when I visited, despite only few patrons.
Various choice of foods, absolutely Java ambience, standard prices. Oh, get some free postcards here!
Biasa saja, hanya terlalu ramai untuk tempat sekecil itu
The food is so good, but kind of scary place ..
Nice place. Tapi antrinya ga kira2
Nice but many other more than this places so find it and try. Thanks HOR (house of ruminten) and thanks jogja
Nice Food and Drink,, but slow service
Many options foods..moderate price..nice place concept..
Many traditional drinks available. Too bad it is not a non smoking place.
Nice place, but you have too queues for a table
Nice place to have food
It's a good place but had bad communication services to customer. Hope the management fix it.
The place is good but not the taste and service
Nice place to dine and hangouts, get together with friends and family
Good traditional place. If you dont like the sense of mystic and smell of
the foods are cheap but the drink like es teh is quite expensive.
i prefer raminten's house than raminten's kitchen. raminten house has more variety of menu than the kitchen.
Asiiik juga ternyata
good place to hangout, the food and drink are average
Not bad food with reasonable price
The food was good but the service very very slow
Cozy place with the low price.... The nice place to chitchat with friends
So so
Good place for affordable snack and food
I was told that this is a must-try restaurant. Food is nothing groundbreaking though. The show is probably what most people come to see.
Fine lah
Good food good service
Traditional restaurant in yogya, but this place is cripy in nigth
Makanannya rasanya kurang nampol
Traditional atmosphere restaurant with javanese food & beverages
give more variant menu .. overall good place
Confused about what to eat... but look nice and make curious...
Too long waiting for foods and drinks, not all staffs friendly, too crowded too.
cool place with yogya ethnic and recommended place to visit in yogyakarta
They have  yummy food and nice place.
Enaa! Steak ayam favoritoo ❤️❤️
I waited too long and it's not as cozy as mentioned
Good food and relax atmosphere...😊...👍

Nice place bad service.. no smile !!!
The waiting list is troublesome. Too crowded.
Famous place, average food
Not so many choices for food and snack.

Crowded place
Berbeda dari Raminten yang lain, resto ini letaknya agak masuk ke dalam, di pinggir jalan raya yang tidak terlampau ramai. Menginjak mulut resto, kami disambut oleh figur Raminten yang jadi ciri khasnya, lengkap dengan ornamen jawa, dan sesajen yang memberi kesan sangat tradisional.  - Tempatnya cukup luas, dua lantai, dan semuanya semi outdoor. Lantai dua tempatnya cukup bersih, hanya saja lantai tangganya ada beberapa bagian yang tidak rata, mengelupas, dan membuat tersandung. Yang sudah pernah ke Raminten pasti tau-lah suasana khas nya seperti apa, jawa banget. Ditambah pula suara kerincingan dari gelang kaki para waiters, membuat aura semakin magis. Jujur saya agak merinding tiap mendengar gemerincingnya, mengingatkan saya dengan pemain kesenian Jathilan.  - Menunya beragam, kebanyakan menu tradisional yang disajikan lebih high class. Soto batok porsinya ya seperti soto batok Sambisari, sedikit, dan kuahnya agak asin. Bakmi godog dan gorennya enak, creamy, gurih, nikmat. Es cendolnya porsinya sangat besar, but nothing special. Rujak es krimnya segar, berisi buah-buahan yang cukup beragam.  - Tempat parkirnya terbatas, kalau di halaman resto sudah penuh, bisa parkir di pinggir jalan.  Bagi kalian yang ingin menikmati hidangan tradisional Jogja dengan nuansa magis dan jawa yang kental, restoran ini bisa menjadi pilihan.
Pelayanannya cukup baik. Sayang, makanannya kurang cocok(tahu walik). Tapi teh pocinya recommended. Luas bangunan cukup besar, tapi tidak maximal peruntukannya.
Untuk suasana tempatnya nyaman, vibes homy nya dpt, pelayanannya jg ramah, cm untuk harga agak mahal yah. Untuk nongkrong sesekali oke lah krn tempatnya enak,
Ke sini 2 kali, terakhir pas sekolah di depan nya itu lg renovasi, jadi brisiknya ya ampun.  Selebihnya sih no complain; makanan yahud, waktu penyajian nya terhitung cepat, pembayaran juga mudah, porsi dan harga worth it, pramusaji nya cekatan dan muda-muda, tlg diapresiasi dan digaji dgn bagus ya @owner.  sy rekomendasikan ke teman-teman.
Makanannya enak, paling suka es kacang merah. Harga juga terjangkau, tapi kalau musim liburan harus rela antri ya biar dapat tempat duduk.
Porsi cukup banyak, taste makanan ok tapi bukan yang special.. rasa agak manis.. es teh manisnya buesar jumbo tapi agak terlalu manis..makanannya 1 jam baru keluar.. agak kecewa untuk waiting timenya..datang jam 14.00 tapi makanan baru keluar jam 15.00
Menu yang dipesan - Nasi ayam keraton - Bakmi godhog pakualaman - Soto bathok - Mendoan - Es lemon tea Untuk rasa bisa dibilang enak Pelayanannya ramah
andalan untuk ngajak tamu luar kota dine in disini... better datang sebelum jam makan atau reservasi dulu utk menghindari antrian... minumannya suka banget tapi makanan nya mungkin perlu dicek lagi utk rasa nya padahal presentasi ud bagus banget... agar kita ygbawa tamu luar kota ini ga kecewa...kemarin sabtu kesini gada kudanya padahal ud promoin ke anak anak ad kuda disini
Vibesnya jawa bgt, ada 2 lantai, pilihan makanan/minuman cukup variatif. Rasa makanannya oke, harganya ga terlalu mahal, lokasi strategis
Makan malam yang termasuknya sangat mengenyangkan dengan porsi yang lumayan jumbo. Tastenya enak, dagingnya empuk, penyajian lumayan cepat,dan variasi menunya cukup banyak. Harga sesuai porsi & citarasa.
Kesini pas liburan lebaran kmrn, waiting list cm 4 grup d depan, tergolong cepat masuknya, stlh pesan lsg bayar dannn nunggu makanannya lamaaa skali, sejam lebih 😌 utk harga pricey banget kl dibandingkan dgn house of raminten. Hargany tdk sesuai dgn porsiny 🤭 Sy pesan nasi sultan seharga 135k per pax tp porsinya tdk semahal harganya 🙈
Untuk makanan rate 8/10 Dan suprisingly nasi nya pake basmati rice. Waktu itu dateng pas weekday dan menjelang sore. Jd gak rame dan gak antre.
Setiap ke Jogja kaya ada yg kurang kalo ngga ke raminten😁. Tempat okee vibesnya Jogja bangeet, buat yang senang nuansa etnik klasik. Tapi menunya ngga sebanyak di house of raminten. Padahal aku lihat review di tiktok masih ada kok menu2nya yg kaya di house of raminten. Kaya ayam koteka dll. Padahal itu yg aku cari. Tapi kalo di raminten kitchen itu tempat nya lebih cozy dah modern gituu. Daj ngga serame di house of raminten. Tapi makanan okee porsinya besarr
Resto 2 lantai dengan suasana, makanan dan minuman khas Yogja
Mampir sekitar jam 11an siang dan masih sepi sekali. Milih duduk di lantai 2 ternyata keputusan yg kurang tepat pas lagi cuaca panas gini makin sumuk deh 😅 Harga cukup mahal tp emang porsinya mayan gede apalagi menu esnya. Rasanyaa yaa oke-oke aja deh. Kirain cabang resto ini luas tempatnya ternyata nggak begitu sih.
Restoran khas Yogyakarta dengan pelayanan unik. Makanan lumayan enak, tp beberapa kurang terutama yang authentic. Walau datang jam 9 malam, makanan keluar lama, tp sebelumnya sudha diinfo. Area ada indoor dan outdoor. Harga sesuai standar resto. Tidak seramai Raminten resto satunya, yang ini lebih modern.
Kedua kali nya datang ,Suasana sore B aja , bebek cabe hijau nya alot , ikan pecak ikan nya sedikit bau lumpur (pecinta ikan pasti tau maksud nya ), pisang coklat keju nya enak tapi pisang nya keras , overall B aja semua , ksini lagi ke tiga kali nya ? Kayana gak deh
Untuk makanannya oke lah. Mie goreng dan  mendoan layak dicoba. Secara layanan juga oke ada nilai plus yaitu naik kuda gratis di sore hari, cuman beberapa kali terganggu karena lalat, akhirnya minta sampai minta lilin. Masukan untuk menyediakan tutup minuman kalau pas banyak lalat sangat membantu, tadi minta tutup minuman ndak ada. Untuk Lokasinya nggak terlalu ramai walaupun di tengah kota, cocok untuk nongkrong dan menikmati waktu bersama keluarga atau teman. Ada pertunjukan tari juga kalau malam bergantian dengan live musik.  Ohya alat sholat sangat memadai mushola nya juga cukup luas. Untuk harga standart... overall Mantab
Ternyata area makan nya ngga yang besar banget ya kirain lega lapang gitu. Untuk makan di atas tangga nya agak curam, hati-hati yang bawa lansia.  Untuk makanan rasanya standart resto, tidak mengecawakan. Order teh tawar gelas nya gede banget, bisa sharing untuk berdua ini sih.  Tapi sayangnya ketika saya makan disini, kondisi sedang hujan lalu tercium aroma "tidak sedap" entah berasal dari kandang kuda di area depan restoran atau limbah luar di sekitar lingkungan.
Rumah makan yang memberikan nuansa etnik jawa. Untuk yang ingin dpt nuansa magis coba pesen teh raminten😊. Kalau rasa seperti banyak yg lebih enak dari rumah makan ini
Rasa makanan biasa saja sebenarnya, hanya suasananya saja yang unik. Menu khas masakan Jawa tapi rasanya justru kureng. Perlu waiting list apalagi kalau musim turis. Pembayaran cash langsung ke pelayannya.
Pertama kali kesini dan serem mistis cuy, mana pesen Teh Racikan Raminten, ga sadar kalo ngirimnya pake tradisi krincingan jalan slow motion dengan menyan, alhasil minum tehnya sambil waswas 😅  Antri cepat karna ga ada antrian sebelumnya, menu keluar agak lama tapi rasa okelah not bad, harganya juga masih wajar dengan porsinya dannnnn no additional tax & service.  Bau mistis dan menyan dimana-mana, sesajen dimana-mana, patung di toilet bawah tangga bikin merinding, better toilet luar sebelah kandang kuda.  Yang gak doyan suasana mistis atau bau-bauan, jangan pernah kesini apalagi ke House of Raminten 😂
Salah satu resto yg wajib dikunjungi kalau lg di Yogyakarta, lokasinya ada bbrp ya bisa cek di google. Aku sdh pernah cobain yg di Jln.Faridan dan skrg pgen cobain yg disini. Lokasinya deket kok sama Malioboro, deket jg sama tempat2 kuliner yg lain. Klo ke Raminten bgtu masuk sdh khas bgt ya dari aroma ruangannya 😁. Designnya hampir2 sama tema jawa2 gitu dilengkapi dg gendingan jawanya dan klo disini bisa melihat lgsg pembuatan batik tulis lho. Untuk makanan dan minuman beraneka ragam yg pasti menu2 jawa. Rasanya standar dan harganya agak pricey tp sebanding dg tempatnya. Pelayanannya ramah dan yg unik disini pelayan restonya smw pakai baju adat jawa.
Tempat nongkrong dengan khas hiburan tarian daerah, cukup menarik untuk minuman teh di sajikan dengan penyajian yang unik
Rasa kurang, suasana nya bagus. Tapi makanan banyak yang kosong. Bisa naik kuda juga. Tempat nya bagus buat foto2. Minumannya gede bgt lohhhhhh. Segentong wkwkwk. Mantap
Tempat makan yang unik karena nuansa budaya dan kuda didalamnya! Pelayannya pun juga menggunakan busana yang kental akan budaya Jogja. Menu yang disajikan juga beragam, dari snack maupun makanan besarnya tanpa menghilangkan budaya Jawanya. Raminten’s Kitchen ini menawarkan harga yang sesuai dengan apa yang didapatkan! Namun bagi saya pelayanannya yang tidak ramah menbuat tempat ini harus mendapatkan rating 4/5.
Manu disini lumayan banyak, dan cepet datangnya. Untuk rasa beberapa pas dan ada yang kurang, tapi masih oke. Dua kali kesini pesen nasi kucing, yang pertama sambelnya pedes abis, sampe mau nangis. Yang tadi lebih pas, sedeng untuk seleraku. Sayur lodehnya enak, gurih santennya pas. Cuma ga terlalu suka sama telur sarangnya, kurang berasa. Lalu mie dog2nya terlalu matang mienya, tapi bumbunya enak, kuahnya gurih bawang gorengnya banyak. Untuk es teh disini enak, sebagai penggermar es teh tawar ini enak, tehnya berasa banget, walaupun harganya 20 ribu tapi porsinya gede polll. Disini tempatnya luas, tempat duduk banyak, bisa lesehan atau kursi. Ada indoor outdoor. Kelebihan 1 lagi, yaitu buka 24 jam. Cuma parkiran sempit dan makan bahu jalan umum.
Pingin coba house of reminten tapi tutup so beralih ke raminten's kitchen yg buka 24 jam ya ternyta. Menu ny indonesian food dan variasi ny lumayan. Pesan nasi berkat dan ayam keraton. Untuk rasa enak tapi agak kaget aja ayam keraton ny bener2 hanya ayam dan nasi aja hehe at least ada lalapan (timun, tomat, selada) lebih asik sih secara harga ny juga lumayan kan. Mungkin bisa dipertimbangkan lah ya. Bumbu rempah ny enak, meresap dan ayam ny empuk. Untuk porsi lumayan banyak ya. Teh poci ny juga ok pakainy gula batu gt.
lunch dsini .. ini punya anak ke 3nya ibu Raminten. adanya dibelakang sma STECE. parkirnya sempit jadi kalau nggak dapat ya parkir pinggir jalan. no AC jadi angin semilir yang jadi andalan. pesan minum es sweet cinnamon but it's not my taste. kurang suka. mendoan gorengnya gurih, lalu pesan nasgor raminten. biasa aja siy. mungkin harus order menu lainnya biar tahu enak apa nggaknya ya. ada 2 lantai tapi lantai atas biasanya dibooked untuk acara. lantai bawah mejanya terbatas jd susah kalau datang pas lg ramai.
Pertama kali kemarin ke sini karena mau ke Raminten yg satunya di Maps karena banyak banget Raminten, akhirnya memilih ke sini karena merasa belum pernah 😂 kami kira ini sama dg yg raminten yg lain, ternyata beda 🤣 beda menu, di sini lebih arah western bgitu.  Tempat luas dan nyaman ✅ Bersih ✅ Makanan enak dan affordable Pelayanan ramah polll karena bagi wisatawan yg baru datang ditanya dan dijelaskan dulu, khawatir banyak yg keliru paling ya 😂 jika mengiinginkan pergi ke Raminten dg menu Indonesia bisa diarahkan ke Raminten yg dituju.
Saya baru-baru ini mengunjungi sebuah restoran yang menawarkan pemandangan yang spektakuler dan suasana yang mirip dengan berada di rumah pribadi. Restoran ini benar-benar menciptakan atmosfer yang nyaman dengan adanya burung berkicau di sekitarnya dan bahkan kuda yang lucu berada di sekitar. Meskipun pengalaman keseluruhan cukup menyenangkan, ada beberapa hal yang membuat saya merasa bahwa konsep dan variasi menu makanan dapat ditingkatkan.  Salah satu hal yang paling mencuri perhatian saya adalah pemandangan yang menakjubkan di sekitar restoran. Terletak di tengah-tengah kota, restoran ini memberikan kesan seolah-olah sedang makan di taman belakang rumah pribadi. Adanya burung yang berkicau di sekitar meja dan kuda yang lucu memberikan sentuhan alami yang sangat menghibur. Suasana yang diciptakan oleh restoran ini benar-benar luar biasa dan membuat makanan saya terasa lebih istimewa.  Namun, ketika datang ke makanan, saya merasa ada beberapa kekurangan dalam hal konsep dan variasi. Meskipun hidangan yang disajikan memiliki kualitas yang baik, rasanya terasa biasa saja. Saya harap restoran ini bisa mengeksplorasi lebih banyak kreativitas dalam menciptakan hidangan yang unik dan menggugah selera. Beberapa pilihan menu yang lebih beragam akan memberikan kesempatan bagi pengunjung untuk mencoba berbagai cita rasa yang menarik.  Saya mengharapkan variasi menu yang lebih luas dan inovatif untuk menambah kepuasan pengunjung. Kemungkinan adanya beberapa hidangan khas atau spesialisasi yang membedakan restoran ini dari tempat lain akan memberikan pengalaman kuliner yang lebih memuaskan. Mungkin juga menambahkan menu vegetarian atau vegan sebagai pilihan bagi tamu yang memiliki preferensi atau kebutuhan diet khusus.  Meskipun makanan memiliki kekurangan dalam hal variasi dan konsep, pengalaman keseluruhan di restoran ini masih patut diacungi jempol. Pemandangan yang menakjubkan dan suasana rumah pribadi yang diciptakan dengan baik memberikan nilai tambah yang signifikan. Layanan yang ramah dan profesional juga patut diapresiasi.  Secara keseluruhan, restoran ini menawarkan pengalaman yang unik dengan pemandangan dan suasana yang luar biasa. Namun, saya berharap mereka dapat meningkatkan variasi dan konsep menu mereka untuk memberikan pengalaman kuliner yang lebih memuaskan. Dengan demikian, restoran ini dapat menjadi destinasi yang sempurna bagi mereka yang menginginkan kombinasi antara suasana alami dan hidangan yang istimewa.
Lama buanget keluarnya pesanan dan itu pun satu datang beberapa lama yg lain baru datang, sampai pesanan terakhir akhirnya minta dibungkus saja
Rasa makanannya so so lah. Tapi mendoan bakarnya layak dicoba. Secara servis juga so so tapi ada beberapa menu yang nggak dikeluarin sampai kita selesai makan. Lokasinya nggak terlalu ramai. Masih cocok untuk menikmati waktu bersama keluarga atau teman.
Beberapa kali kesini bahkan dari jaman jauh sebelum pandemi.  Suka sama mbak dan mas karyawan disini karna ramah dan juga wearing a traditional javanese uniform.  Harganya FnB disini juga murah meriah.  Sekarang juga sudah ada varian kopi, jadi makin betah nongkrongnya. Apalagi buka 24 jam yaa hehe Kalo bingung mau nongks tapi gatau mau dimana, biasanya kami kesini.  Kamar mandinya juga bersih.  Yang menarik perhatian kami, di dekat kasir ada rak jajanan jadul yang dulu aku sering beli dimasa SD 🥰  Tenkyuuuuuuu 🥳
Review :  Lokasi : Strategis area kota baru. Dekat dengan stella duce. Namun sayang untuk jam2 rame parkir mobil agak sulit.  Tempat : Nyaman untuk sekedar makan atau nongkrong. Konsep : Self service.  Menu : Ayam gepreknya favorit saya sama suami karna bisa request cabai rawit yang digunakan 😂 Variatif desert dan minumnya banyak. Kebetulan suka puding ternyata disini ada, lucuk ada bunganya nd Rasanya oke lagi. Next nyobain puding yg lainnya 😍 Buat yang suka jejamuan, rasa jamunya jg lumayan kok  Price : 10rb up  Untuk pelayanan semua baik dan sangat ramah.  Advice : Karna konsep resto self service and self waste cleaning. Dikarnakan karakteristik dari customer berbeda2 perilaku dan habit. Maka sebaiknya pihak resto perlu tanggap serta sigap untuk slalu menjaga kebersihan area resto dari setiap sisi terlebih tempat waste storagenya. Agar customer yg datang slalu nyaman untuk menjadikan raminten kichen sbagai tempat favorit makan bersama teman ataupun sekedar nongkrong meskipun self service.  Sukses slalu untuk seluruh bagian manajemen raminten.
Murah harga makanannya porsi ok variasi banyak pelayanan baik cukup bersih hanya saja sy tdk sk lesehan... d sini lesehan smua heheee...
Resto unik, saya pesan ayam keraton dan es tape susu. Penyajian makanan cukup lama, penyajian minumnya cepat. Masih berbau mistis, mungkin saya tidak ingin berkunjung lagi ke tempat ini. Rasa masakan ayam keraton kurang cocok di lidah saya.
Saat kemari bukan saat liburan atau weekend jadi ada beberapa menu yg kosong. Porsi cemilan lumayan besar. Utk rame-rame pun dengan 3 macam menu kok Masih gak habis. Minumannya juga porsi jumbo.  Tempatnya indoor dan semi outdoor. Parkirnya sempit. Harus parkir di seberang jalan. Ada mushola kecil di bagian belakang.
Tempat makan strategis di tengah kota dengan suasana khas Raminten, penuh pernak-pernik etnik dan perabot lawasan. Menu makanan dan minuman bervariasi, cukup banyak alternatif untuk dipilih. Porsi makanan dan minuman cenderung besar. Dari segi rasa bintang lima. Saya mencoba sego ayam lombok ijo, rasanya enak, tidak mengecewakan. Jenang jawanya juga enak. Hanya saja suasananya agak terganggu karena sedang proses renovasi.
Untuk rasa makananya menurun dibanding dulu, jadi terkesan biasa saja, untuk harga masih bisa dibilang ok, untuk penyajian cukup lama
Tempatnya selalu rame dan disarankan untuk antri pesan tempat sebelum lapar..lols.. yang pasti kudu sabar.. bagi yang gak bisa lesehan lebih baik bilang ke waiters minta tolong untuk meja makan dengan kursi. Ada kandang kuda juga dekat dengan toilet. Untuk menu variasi banyak dan porsinya juga bikin kenyang. Lokasinya sendiri gampang dijangkau dengan grab, gojek atau bus Transjogja.
Makan dan nongki2 di sini ok banget.. Masakannya juga ok. Porsi es teh nya gelas besar 😁 puas jadi nya. Raminten kitchen ini bisa jadi alternative kalo house of Raminten lagi full. Mampir2 deh kalo ke Yogyakarta. Pilihan makanan, cemilan, minumannya cukup bervariasi.
Kesini untuk breakfast, lumayan lengkap menunya. buka 24 jam. bisa hangout dengan temen2. interiornya sangat menarik. harganya masih standar sih, gak mahal banget, gak murah banget.
Pelayanan ramah, datang di sambut, ada mushola nya, menu makan wort it bisa kenyang tampilan makan rapi indah. Susana jawa ada yg muter2 bakar dupa 😁
Tempatnya instagramable. Banyak spot fotonya. Bisa indor maupu  outdor. Nuansanya khas nuansa jawa. Macam menunya juga berfariasi. Harga rata2 resto d jogja. Penyajiannya cepat. Untuk rasa standar
Tempat ini satu kepemilikan dengan Mirota Batik dan The House of Raminten. Buka 24 jam, terdiri dari dua lantai. Pemesanan langsung bayar di lantai 1 dan makannya di lantai 2. Menurut saya sistem taking ordernya agak crowded yah... Pesen ayam geprek bayar di kasir langsung digreprekin sama kasirnya di depan mata. Akhirnya customer lain menunggu. Btw di belakang tempat ini ada kandang kuda.
Restonya enak suasananya, dengan lagu-lagu nostalgia, pake bahasa Belanda, lagi. Dari suasana, nyaman. Apalagi kalau kursinya dibikin yang lebih cozy.  Dari harganya, ok banget. Rp 12.500 udah dapet nasi putih, 1 potong ayam yang bisa digeprek, tempe goreng dan sayur. Minumnya yang di luar paket. Ada cold brew dingin yang nendang banget, cuma Rp 12.000!  Selain menu ayam geprek, ada juga menu-menu lainnya, tentu semua dengan harga terjangkau, dan...buka 24 jam!  Mengusung tema self service, tamu diharapkan dapat juga menumpuk bekas makan dan minum di tempat yang telah disediakan, namun hal ini rupanya belum disadari oleh tamu, sehingga pramusaji yang hanya beberapa gelintir agak kewalahan membersihkan meja.  No wonder, banyak nih yang suka nongkrong di sini, buat nunggu atau nyari kekasih hati keluar dari srkolah yang tepat berada di depannya...
Lokasinya ga jauh dari The House of Raminten yang di Kobar. Di Raminten's Kitchen suasananya lebih terbuka. Spot makannya ga terlalu banyak. Pilihan menunya juga ga terlalu banyak. Tapi tempatnya asik buat foto-foto. Kalau soal harga di sini lebih mahal dibanding The House of Raminten.
Masakannya enak-enak. Masakan khas tradisional. Cuma mau makan disini harus sabar karena mengantri. Dan makanan yang kita pesan keluar agak lama. Tp semua terbayar dengan kenikmatan dari masakannya.
Tempatnya cukup instagramable. Harga menu sedikit mahal terutama untuk minuman. Kalau makanan ada soto bathok yang harganya cuma 7rb, rasanya enak.
Raminten mungkin sudah menjadi icon kuliner nya jogja.. Ga afdol klo ga makan di raminten pas liburan ke jogja .. Suasana nya adem agak remang remang, ada alunan tembang tembang jawa gitu plus ada bau bau dupa ... Suasana NJawa banget... Saking antri nya dan penuh sampai ada tempat duduk seperti ketika antri di bank atau di rumah sakit gitu .. Untuk makannya over all enak kok.. harga nya murah standar jogja Waktu itu saya pesan nasi soto, nasi goreng telur, bakmi jawa, telur bakar, tempe mendoan, tempe kriuk, singkong salju, dawet jumbo, dll Saking ramenya jadi agak lama pesanan datang...xixixiixi... Dimaklumi ajah
Tempat makan yg cocok untuk nongkrong sklian ngerjain tugas, kebanyakan yg datang pelajar&mahasiswa. Datang lngsung pesan di kasir, utk minuman bisa lngsung pilih di kulkas yg sudah di sediakan, pesan makan lngsung dan nanti nunggu dibuatkan lalu bayar dan bawa sendiri makanan ke meja nya. Sistem self service gitu. Tp ada beberapa menu yg nanti bakal dianterin ke meja kita. Bisa refill minum; ada es teh dan infus water. Ada 2 lantai, yg diatas ada lesehannya juga. Tempatnya cukup luas. Makanannya nya enak. Harga standar.
Salah 1 tempat makan yg famous di Jogja. Rasanya enak, harga bersahabat, pelayanan baik, porsi banyak, tempat bersih dan nyaman, ada taman di tengah resto dan banyak spot foto cantik. Ada musholla dan toiletnya banyak
Tempatnya unik dan ramai. Untuk bisa menikmati hidangan disini kita harus mengantri. Makanannya juga enak dan bervariasi. Kalo ke Jogja,  gak lengkap rasanya jika belum berkunjung ke House of Raminten ☕🍴🍲🍛
Rawonnya kurang enak... tp porsi nya besar. Nasi brongkos nya enakkk. Pisang goreng dan rotbar coklat nya enak. Esteh nya enak dan pake gelas besar. Vibes nya suka, dan ada pertunjukan nari kemarin, suka bgt.
Tempatnya unik. Harga makanan lumayan terjangkau. Rasa juga lumayanlah. Bau dupa dimana-mana, seperti berada di Bali. Pelayannya seksi 😂 Bagi yang datang bersama suami, harus tutup mata suami saat pelayan perempuan mencatat pesanan anda.
Tenpat makan yang cukup enak, makanannya terlihat bersih, tempat parkir juga banyak  1. Pecel : pecelnya bumbunya enak tapi varian sayurnya cuma dikit 2. Ayam Cabe : ayamnya cukup pedas namun masih enak 3. Toge : togenya biasa saja 4. Kikil : kikilnya empuk dan pedas 5. Cabe Bawang : Sangat pedas 6. Pare : tidak pahit dan enak 7. Daun singkong : daun singkongnya enak karena dicampur teri 8.Tempe : tempenya enak masih berbulir dan asin 9. Usus : usunya empuk tapi kalau di goreng lebih mantap
Yg lagi liburan di jgj perlu dicoba... harga murah , suasana yg nyaman, makanan cukup enak, cmn syg sayur asem rasanya ga asem tapi manis. Yg lain nya okeee
Raminten kitchen relatif berkonsep lebih modern dan garden, suasanya cukup nyaman.. Menu cukup enak.. Porsi besar. Harga relatif lebih murah
tepatnya rame, dari luar sudah tercium aroma mistis. harus daftar dulu untuk mengantre. nungguin pesan di pelayan lama, masakannya juga datangnya lama. ini waktu saya datang ke sini tim OK FOOD belum ke mari. harganya termasuk murah untuk tempat yang seperti ini. dekorasinya menunjukkan kalo tempat ini klasik.
Bisa lihat sejarah raminten di foto 2 yg ada di resto nya. Suasananya asyik Sistem pembayaran nya CASH only Parkir motor dan mobil di pinggir jalan
Tempatnya bersebelahan dengan hamzah batik, jadi sambil liat batik, sehabis itu lunch. Makanannya enak semua, tempatnya outdoor cozy dengan lantunan lagu jawa. Harga murah, tapi gak murahan. Overall, good place to spend.
pemiliknya sama dengan warung raminten, namun ini konsepnya berbeda, kita dituntut untuk self service sendiri masakannya agak standar blm ada yg istimewa, hanya saja tempatnya unik dan kita bisa sekalian menikmati kandang kuda yang berada tepat disebelah tempat makan kita
Tempatnya kurang luas
Raminten cabang baru dgn konsep baru yg lebih anak muda. Lantai 2 nya berkonsep semi outdoor, kalau siang enak banget buat santai². Sayangnya opsi menu nya sedikit bgt. Tapi percayalah ayam nya super enak, wajib coba!  Kalau mau makan malam di sini, sebaiknya datang sebelum jam makan (jam 5-6) atau malah malam bgt sekalian (jam 8-9) karena tempat ini bakal jadi super ramai & banyak bookingan saat malam.  Di sini disediakan station pembuangan utk bersihin peralatan makan kita. Jadi habis makan, bawa nampan plus piring²nya, sendok²nya, & sampah²nya ke station itu dan tempatkan sesuai kategorinya. Supaya pelanggan yg baru dateng merasa nyaman, meja yg mau dipakai sudah bersih 😊
Ati kalo pesen teh anget disini... Porsinya gelas besar banget,... Nasinya juga banyak... Buat anak2 bisa naik kuda gratis,.. suasana enak sebenarnya,.... Tp kurang nyaman karena blm selesai makan udah ditagih suruh bayar hanya karena pergantian shift kasirnya...
Tempatnya cukup rame Menu2nya enak Pelayananya ramah
Menu tradisionalnya banyak pilihan, harga terjangkau, rasanya enak, porsinya banyak. G salah klo mw makan d sini antri bgt
Bisa dibilang tempat ini adalah Raminten dengan konsep kekinian. Terletak di seberang Stece, tidak jauh dari The House of Raminten yang sudah melegenda. Menu cukup beragam walau tidak terlalu banyak, mulai dari nasi goreng hingga mie goreng geprek, harga pun bersahabat. Jika pesan es teh bisa refill. Selesai makan kita pun membereskan sendiri dengan membawa nampan dan piring ke tempat yang sudah disediakan. Area parkir mobil dan motor cukup luas, hanya saja tempatnya agak sedikit panas. Overall lumayan untuk sekadar nongkrong bareng teman-teman.
Tempatnya enak, bisa lesehan sama ada tempat duduk biasanya juga, sudah menajlankan protokol kesehatan, pelayannya ramah2 , makannnya enak
Berada di Malioboro Jogya....tepatnya di lt3....batik hamzah. Suasana cukup menyenangkan, porsi makanan jumbo, hanya pelayanan agak lamban. Tapi mungkin krn sy berkunjung bertepatan dg hari sabtu siang jelang sore, suasananya cukup rame, beberapa menu sdh habis.
Harga murah suasana tradisional jawa terasa banget, makanan juga cepat disajikan gak terlalu lama, cuma kalau pas weekend penuh, harus menunggu antri masuk.
Lokasi depan SMA Stella Duce 1, saat ini lagi masa renovasi jadi sedikit tidak nyaman kondisinya  Restoran sedikit sempit dengan banyaknya meja dan kursi, di lantai bawah sedikit susah untuk lewat, lantai atas cukup lega  Harga menu cenderung mahal, saat ini menunya berisi makanan tradisional seperti nasi sayur dan ayam geprek, dengan konsep angkringan  In frame : nasi+sayur+ayam original Rp20.000,00
Tempatnya asyik, pelayannya pakai baju khas jogja dengan bel di kakinya. Ada kuda dan kereta kencana. Jogja banget...  Makanannya biasa aja.... Harga lumayan bersahabat
Resto ini makanannya enak lengkap dan pesanan datang tidak lama.. harga disini pun saya kira tidak mahal.. bila dibandingkan dengan rumah makan lain di jogja.. disini pesan langsung bayar jadi tinggal pulang kalau selesai makan.. suasana jawa tempo dulu terasa sekali dengan ornamen ² yang ada dan bunga2 serta dupa.. o.iya dibelakang deket toilet ada kuda.. bagi punya anak kecil pasti suka he3
Menu makan nya modern dibungkus dengan nuansa tradisional. Harga nya ga mahal kok, ayam geprek 18K. Untuk minuman ada banyak jenis nya. Kopi dan non kopi semua ada. Tempat nya luas, ga usah khawatir, bisa buat banyak orang. Parkir motor lumayan luas. Kalo bawa mobil parkir nya pinggir jalan.
Pros: - Harga murah meriah - Banyak menu-menu yang tidak biasa - Cocok untuk keluarga  Cons: - Antrian panjang - Tidak ada area parkir khusus (parkir pinggir jalan raya)
Masakannya sebenarnya biasa saja cuman unik di es n minuman nya..tempatnya sumpek..sempit... Dan bau dupanya aq gak suka bikin gak selera makan..mushola nya juga susah hrus naik ke atas, menunya ada nasi kucing,gudek, pecel ayam dan dll yg unik minuman nya yaitu susu prawan tancep,yg lain dr yg lain suasana dan tempatnya
The food is nice Bisa liat pertunjukan tari, pelayannya ramah2
tempatnya nyaman, harga terjangkau, dan mendapat suasana lain dng koleksi patung2  dan peninggalan kuno yg eksotis tapi tdk suka antrinyaa panjaaanggg
Menu makanan dan minuman variatif banget dan harga nya murah. Cocok untuk keluarga dan pasangan. Interiornya  menarik. Begitu masuk akan disambut wanginya aroma dupa. Dan paling asiknya tempat ini buka 24 jam, jadi bisa kapan saja kalau mau kesana
Menu kurang lengkap. . tp yaa untunge enak sih. Perbanyak menunya yaa... Btw es jeruknya 20rb gaes! Haha
Worth it untuk bukber bareng temen2, suasana dan pelayanan oke bangett
Karna waiting list di raminten house nya banyak banget jadinya kesini. ini lebih tempat makan modern sekarang, tapi masih disuguhi alunan musik dan aroma tradisional.
Tempatnya cukup nyaman Nuansa jawa banget Makanan lama penyajiannya Harga cukup pricey
Harga dan rasa worth it. Tempatnya luas dan unik ada  kuda di sampingnya. Cuma pas ke sana wifi mati dan beberapa meja belom dibersihkan masih kotor
Beberapa hari yg lalu mampir makan siang di sini, mungkin karena musim liburan jd antrian panjang dan makanannya datang agak lama. Suasananya khas jogja banget, pelayanan ramah, makanannya enak
Tempat makan yang cukup enak, banyak jenis menu tradisional Indonesia, harga terjangkau, tapi sayangnya banyak lalat. Semoga lalatnya dikasih makan sendiri biar ga ganggu makanan yang kita pesan. Hehe..just kidding.
Tempatnya bersiiih,,,colokan banyak,,,pelayannya super duper ramahhh. Gw banyak nanya krna pertama kali, mereka ngeladenin dg ramah, gak intimidatif. Ada infise water dan es teh sepuasnya. Toilet super bersih dan nyaman. Makanan mah selera lah ya, kalo buat gw sih biasa aja rasanya. Tapi gw kesini emang bukan cari makanan enak, tp cari tempat nyanan,buat kerja sambil makan seadanya. Hahaha
Tempat makan yang siap sedia 24 jam. Perut tenang. Menu sayur asem agak kurang ok dibanding raminten kaliurang.
Kami makan sekeluarga, ada yg pesan mie godhog, ayam keraton, gudeg, garang asem....menurut mereka makanannya enak. Suasanya juga nyaman ramai tapi tidak berdesak desakan.
Toilet bersih nyaman . . Makanan unik , sepadan dengan harga Target : kalangan menengah keatas All occasions ok ( breakfast lunch dinner )
Tempatnya aesthetic dan makanannya beragam dan cukup unik, rasanya enak Tetapi untuk menunggu pencatatan pesanan cukup lama
Jangan kaget kalau harga menunya beda sama House of Raminten yaaa hehehe...  Tapi walaupun harganya sedikit lebih tinggi daripada saudaranya, Raminten's Kitchen juga punya keunikan tersendiri, suasana taman yg segar, asri dan area outdoor yang cukup luas bikin rasa lega dan betah berlama-lama di sana. Banyak juga background foto yang bisa jadi calon koleksi profil medsos.  Sayangnya, mereka mendeskripsikan americano = espresso, jd ketika sy pesan espresso, yg datang ya americano... Karena disana tidak ada espresso, tapi punya americano...  Jadi buat yg biasa menyeruput espresso, pastikan mbak/mas yg menerima order tau kalau anda maunya cuma espresso-nya aja, tanpa tambahan airnya...
Tempat nyama untuk nongkrong bareng teman-teman, Instagramable juga, kamar mandi bersih, tapi sayangnya bagian musola seperti kurang terawat dibandingkan dengan bagian yang lainnya, selain itu juga tida ada wifi
Tempat makan yang unik, ala ala vintage, instagramable buat mengisi feed instagram anda. Rasa makanannya juga enak, minuman berbagai jamu yang bikin lelah hilang. Seragam karyawannya juga unik, untuk harga tidak terlalu mahal (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.) Ada toilet, sayang belum ada mushola. Mejanya muat untuk banyak orang, namun untuk anak kecil terlalu tinggi, hehe
Salah satu cabang dari usahanya bapak Hamzah atau yang kita kenal sebagai Raminten. Tempat ini menunya berbeda dengan House of Raminten. Di Raminten's Kitchen menyediakan menu ayam geprek dan beberapa menu lain. Memang menunya tidak sebanyak di House of Raminten tapi di Raminten's Kitchen free refill aires dan es teh manis lohh. Di lantai 1 dilarang merokok dan di lantai 2 area outdoor dan boleh merokok
Tempat makan yang memiliki konsep sangat unik, juga tempat makan yang berbeda dengan lainnya. Membuat tempat makan ini menjadi days tarik sendiri bagi para pengunjungnya. Pelayanannya yang ramah, juga nuansa yang sang at damai, dengan alunan musik jawa dapat kalian temukan disini, makanan nya juga enak banget Dan harga yang ditawarkan pun bersahabat. Ada peliharaan pemilik resto yaitu, kuda Dan kerbau dibelakanh dekat dengan toilet
Tempat yg cocok buat makan siang bareng keluarga. Datang sekitar jam 2 dan waktu tunggu makan tidak terlalu lama (15menitan) seperti yg dibilang orang. Buat yg suka pedes pesen sambel lagi karena kadang ada menu yg tidak pakai sambal. Makanan biasa aja tapi tempatnya enak👍
Otentik suasana jogya banget. Makanannya lumayan asyik dan spesifik unik namun umum di lidah orang indonesia.
Love the ambience bgt, also the service is good bcs the waiters is very responsive, ramah bgt, dan cekatan pol Utk makanan dibilang enak ya gak terlalu tp dibilang gak enak juga engga, ya so so aja Dan unfortunately waktu kemarin kesana makanan keluar super lama, pdhl its just baksoㅜㅜ But ya overall okey lah
sering waiting list untuk makan di sini jadi harus pinter2 cari jam yg tepat biar gak WL. kalau lagi rame n sudah dapat tempat duduk terus mau order kadang waiter nya bilang "tunggu sebentar" tapi lama datengnya/gak dateng2 😅. harga makanan dan minuman terbilang cukup murah. atmosphere nya autentik jawa banget dg aroma dupa.
Menunya beragam, enaak, harganya cukup murah. Tempatnya unik. Tp jangan kesana kl sedang kelaparan,krn waiting listnya cukup panjang
Menunya ayam geprek gitu enak, bumbunya terasa. Ada sayurnya juga. Tempatnya bagus nyaman cuma bau kuda kalau makan d lt atas. Krn di belakangnya ada kandang kuda.
Bagus bangett tempat outdoornya, cm sayang klo hujan gk bisa duduk disana jdnya..
Makanannya enaaaak dan sangat bersahabat harganya.. apalagi yg porsi sharing..hemat banget lah..
Tempatnya nyaman banget... Menu tradisional Jogja...
Raminten selain di kotabaru dan jakal. Ini lokasi nya sepertinya di kota baru juga tapi bukan yg 'mainstream' satunya hehe. Depan sekolah stisi.  Toilet bersih. Makanan cukup lengkap dan minuman juga. Tapi sayang menu makanan dan minumannya tidak ada. Jadi mau pilih makanan & minuman jadi kebingungan :( Karena sepertinya makanannya prasmanan.  Tersedia lantai 2. Tempatnya cukup asyik drpd lantai 1.
Tempatnya bagus, penuh ornamen jawa, banyak lukisan, patung, hiasan dnding batik, etc. Meja kursi nyaman ada semi indoor ada outdoor yg lgsg bisa lihat seni tari.  Makanan pesen nasgor raminten dan mie godog dua2nya enak. Minuman pricey bgt tp porsi jumbo. Esteh 18k Esjeruk 20k tp segentong banget :)))
suka banget makan disini, menu nya macam². kalo aku kesini seringnya buat dinner. malam² lebih seru soalnya. paling sering sih pesennya es jeruk ma nasi goreng. tapi, selalu ramai dan bikin males ngantri. tapi nunggunya sih sebanding dengan makanannya yg enak :)
Lokasi pusat kota, view lantai 2 bagus nyaman semilir. Rasa enak cuma harga sesuaikan kantong...
Kirain the house of raminten ternyata salah, tp tmptnya lumayan oke si buat ngobrol malem2 krn tutupnya jam 12. Makanannya enak yg biasa aja, tp mi gorengnya terlalu manis, ga sanggup habisinnya
makanannya murah, resto ini konsepnya jawa tapi ya gitu deh. coba aja sendiri, kalo antri harus sabaaar
Secara lokasi cukup mudah ditemukan. Lahan parkir tidak terlalu luas. Tersedia dua lantai yang bisa dipilih oleh pengunjung. Banyak dekorasi khas Jawa gitu seperti batik. Hanya saja penyajiannya lama banget. Kurangnya lagi adalah saya sudah tunggu lama-lama ternyata makanan hanya dateng 1 macam saja, pesanan lainnya ternyata tidak ada. Saya minta ganti menu ice cream gedang, ternyata tidak tersedia juga. Pihak Raminten merekomendasikan ketan hitam dan menjamin hanya 5 menit untuk bisa disajikan dan saya mengiyakan. Selang hampir 5 menit kemudian, dikabari lagi kalau ketan hitamnya tidak tersedia. Sangat disayangkan karena saya menunggu lama tapi pesanan saya tidak tersajikan. Hanya minuman dan menu teman saya yang sampai. Akhirnya kami makan sepiring berdua karena sudah tidak mau nunggu terlalu lama lagi dan takutnya nanti kosong lagi. Setidaknya rasa makanan yang sampai ke meja kami, enak. Tolong ditingkatkan lagi ya pelayanannya, terimakasih
restaurant yang lumayan murah ditambah lagi suasana yang kaya dirumah sendiri. Lebih mantap lagi sistem self-service yang berbeda,dengan restaurant2 lainya😁
Mohon maaf kemarin beli minum matamu, es soklat, rujak es krim dan mendoan..nggak tahu.biasanya aman..diperjalanan pulang kami mual muntah..dari berempat 2 yg keracunan..hari ini ketemu tamu dari Surabaya..ternyata juga mengalami hal.yg sama di hari yg sama...mhn diperhatikan ada apa dgn makanannya..kami penggemar Ramingten soalnya .terima.kasih
Rest khas yogya, aromanya k khas bgt berbau menyan gitu, makanannya juga enak, murah bisa dikatakan begitu bagi anak kos diawal kiriman wkwkwkwkkwk..... Tapi sering ngantri ya terutama dimalam minggu...
tempatnya bagus tp harganya lumayan mahal untuk ayam geprek dan risol seharga 6k
Menunya ayam geprek dan ayam tepung. Nilai tambahnya, ada sayur. Bisa pilih sayur lodeh atau sayur asem. Harga terjangkau. Tempat enak buat nongki
Suasana Khas Jawa, Nyaman , Dengan Alunan Musik Jawa... Cuma waktu penyajian bisa 30 menit Bru datang, jadi kalau pas laper banget tidak recommended......
Tempatnya unik,makanan beragam,harga terjangkau.Kunjungi youtube TADIRA LIFE🙋‍♂🍱 ya
Biasanya makanan enak, tetapi kemarin pas datang pesan bakwan jagung rasanya agak asam, mungkin adonan sudah tll lama jadi asam.... sebaiknya diperhatikan kesegaran bahan ... Kalau untuk minuman enak enak.... Tempat juga sekarang lebih nyaman tidak bau kencing kuda.... Harga lumayan ramah dikantong untuk standar kafe... Enak buat ngobrol n kongkow....
Pisang goreng & mendoan bakarnya enak dan harga terjangkau! Untuk harga menu makanan beratnya agak pricey, tp disini ga terlalu ramai jd gaperlu antri.
Jika kesini, kamu akan mendapatkan paket kumplit..Suasana yogyakarta, makanan yg lezat dan harga sangat bersahabat.. 😍😍 Love this place 😘
Waktu itu kesininya agak maleman, tapi tetep aja WL dulu.  Dapet tempat duduknya di yang deket rumah kek museum gitu, banyak barang-barang antik, tapi nyeremin liatnya 😅😅.  Nyobain eskrim goreng, mayan unik lah ya, karena ga semua cafe ada menu ini. Terus sama nasi kucing atau apa lah itu namanya, porsinya seuprit banget.
Tempatnya cozy buat ngobrol, suasananya jawa banget, byk ornamen2nya, bisa buat spot foto untuk yg suka foto2, untuk harga makanan agak high price..
Rasanya biasa aja. Lama banget mungkin pas rame. Tapi memang tempatnya bagus untuk foto2.
Makan ayam geprek dengan suasana kekinian. Resto ini buka 24 jam, tempatnya luas dengan arsitektur yg unik, 2 lantai, dan halaman belakang istal! Pilihan menu tidak sebanyak di House of Raminten. Self service dengan pembayaran di awal, nasi boleh ambil sepuasnya. Bila memesan teh, pengunjung bisa refill gratis tapi hanya ada di lantai 1. Di sini kita harus merapikan sendiri semua bekas peralatan makan dengan meletakkannya di kabinet yang tersedia di pojok ruangan.
Sperti biasa datang ketempat ini untuk menikmati alunan gamelan dan juga makanan rumahan yang selalu rindu untuk di santap. Suasana sangat cozy di temani alunan gamelan dan juga bau dupa yang semakin membuat syahdu suasana. Overall tempat ini bisa sebgaia salah satu alternative untuk berkumpul bersama teman teman dan keluarga.
Makanannya lumayan enak, self service, tersedia refil infus water dan teh dingin. Bagi pecinta makanan pedas bolehlah pesan ayam gepreknya lima cabe 😂
Kesna pas ada Acra. TemPatnya asik Bngt. Mkanan dan minumannya Jg harGa standar. . Ada bNyak Kata2 Motivasi. Keren. .  Raminten Botol nya Yg GreenTea sama Thai tea enaK. .😊😊  Di Lantai 2 bnyak Nyamuk, mgkin cz terbuka Kali ya. 😢😢
Kata d tiktok harganya murah². Taunya murah² versi jaksel hahhaa. Tapi enaknya dia 24 jam gtu bukanya
Suasana Jogja terasa klasik dan mistis. Makanan cukup dan authentic Jogja klasik. Pramusaji dengan pakaian Jawa. Pelayanan cukup cepat. Harga sangat terjangkau.
Sebuah tempat yang menjadi tujuan wisata kuliner di yogyakarya, selain desain tempat yang unik aneka makanan dan sajiannya menggunakan bahasa jawa itu juga menjadikan uniknya tempat ini Ditempat ini juga dipamerkan aneka barang barang kuno dan proses membatik ... Dengan iringan musik tradisional jawa Untuk harga tidak perlu khawatir ... semua relatif murah dan enak
Makanannya enak, tp bangku sm meja gak nyaman buat makan, perut ketekuk euyy, sendoknya kebesaran dan ceper sementara piring kekecilan makan bnyk yg tumpah... Pas dtg bnyk makanan yg habis setelah menunggu lama
Tergolong pricey, tp penolong saat malam2 kelaparan krn buka 24jam. Kemarin datang jam 3 dinihari...sedikit kaget krna teh poci pesanan kami disajikan bersama dgn dupa dan kembang. Dan saat pelayan menyajikan teh poci waiters seperti melakukan ritual2 sebelum hidangan kami nikmati. Overall oke utk experience yg beda makan di resto.
Lokasi depan stece,sistemnya mandiri bawa sendiri bersihin sendiri gitu,bersih tempatnya,toilet nya wangi,bangunan unik, harga ya mayan si,waktu pesen mi geprek mi nya ngak mateng sama sekali hehe
Menu cukup bervariasi
Rasa menunya enak-enak, suasana Jogja nya terasa banget, pelayanan ramah, lokasi mudah di jangkau
menunya banyakk...parkir rada susah mesti dijalan gitu...tempat oke sih...ngantri 5 mesti berdiri kalo minggu apa lagi pas makan siang
Suka lbh segee udaranya terang dan berasa kolonial aroman yg khas bikin lsg inget
Enak buat nongkrong sama teman2 dan menunya lumayan enak. Ada jamunya juga..hehe
Kalau menurut saya lebih nyaman di House of Raminten, tapi so far untuk makanan dan pelayananya sama oke nya
Makanannya ala2 rumahan gitu (menurutku) lalu sistem nya itu kita daftar dulu trus nanti di panggil sama babang2 nya. Konsep pelayannya pake pakaian khas yogya dan ramah2. Tapi ya harus sabar menanti karena antusiasme pengunjung kesana lumayan banyak walau bukan hari libur. Harga makanan terjangkau abis rata2 per makanan ga lebih dari rp 25.000 lo... puas deh ya ga nguras kantong pula. Yang juara sih kemaren sambel pecelnya... ha ha ha ha
Recommended untuk mencari tempat makan yg enak dengan suasana tempat yang nyaman
Makanan nya enak, suasana asyik...parkiran sempit/ terbatas..u/ parkir motor di pinggir jalan...🤭
Suasanya khas adat Jawa dan makanannya juga selain enak harganya  terjangkau. Raminten di Jogja ada juga di kaliurang
Tempat makan yang oke banget, dengan harga yg relatif terjangkau, porsi cukup besar, dan suasana yang jawa sekali... cukup unik karena pelayan nya menggunakan busana yg sedikit terbuka... namun masih dalam batas kewajaran ya....
Datang pas makan siang, pas ga rame. Dengan suasana tradisional dan ramah, nyaman sekali makan di sini. Porsi makannya mengenyangkan dan minumnya banyak. Untuk rasa aman dan standar, ga ada komplain.
Tempatnya bersih, enak sih buat nongki, yg dibawah adem jg. So far makanannya jg enak.
Makanannya enak,  biarpun lama nunggu tp pd saat sudah pesan, makanannya cepat datang...  Harga pas dkantong
Tempatnya sgt tradisional khas Jogja.. makanannya enam dan murah2. tp tidak suka dgn bau dupa nya.. menyengat hidung dan juga pelayanannya kurang cpt
enak, beli nasi gudeg sm gorengannya 👌👌 harganya terjangkau
Priceless. Tempatnya lumayan nyaman, menu nya banyak, tp agak lama penyajian nya.
Kalau tdk reservasi sabar menanti.
Tempatnya asik, makanan  lumayan. Garang asem nya kurang suka. Tapi bakmie gorengnya juara. Harga lumayan. Pelayanan ramah.
Pelayanan memuaskan, respon cepat tdk menunggu lama. Makanan enak rasa pas sepadan dengan harga.
Kalo udah masuk kesini kita berasa masuk di Jogja jaman dulu kala😄 tetep jogja bgt lah. Ngdate bareng cewek Medan Horas!  Mbak Rahel 🙋
Soal rasa tetep jos seperti terakhir kesini di 2015. Tapi ornamen sudah mulai usang dan berdebu, baiknya diperhatikan :)
Tempatnya nyaman, pewe banget, cuma pilihan menu nya kurang banyak... matcha botol nya nyusss sih , sukak !
Oke pelayanan nya ramah, makanan oke lah.
Saya memesan nasi kotak dan rasa makanannya enak, namun kombinasinya kurang pas.
Makanannya cukup enak, tempatnya bagus dan nyaman, tapi pelayanan sedikit lama.
suasananya beda, untuk makanannya biasa dan lama pesanannya
Tempat nyaa nyentrik banget, terus muraaah juga untuk makanan dan minumannya. Disini buka 24jam, banyak makananya & minumannya juga
Resto yg menghadirkan romantisme jawa. Sayangnya pengunjungnya penuh dan harus antri dulu, jd gagal romantis....
Ngantri,mknan lama kluarnya tp rasanya enak2 gak bikin kecewa  jogja bgt pelayanya jg pakai baju adat Arah k toilet dekat dapur ada kandang kuda ,bau e'ek &  pipis kuda klo kita lewat 👍👍👍
Harganya murah, makanan enak tapi suasananya jawa banget kaya bau dupa-dupa, ngeri ngeri gimana gitu hahaha recommended lah kalo mau makan di jogja suasana beda :D
Menu nya kurang lengkap dibanding raminten jakal. Fastfood semua, harus antri dulu saat memesan makanan. Toiletnya bersih
Varian menunya sedikit, tp utk rasanya termasuk enak. cocok utk kumpul2 bareng temen. Tempat mudah utk dicari.
Pesen nasi goreng cuman rasa nasi nya sedikit pahit namun untuk yg ayam dan lin lain nya enak. Pelayanan nya lumayan lama...
Menunya oke
Makanannya enaak dan bumbunya terasa banget. Namun karena season liburan, menunggu makanannya cukup lama
Makanannya enak, suasananya juga homey, ada live musicnya keren..
Tempatnya Cozy, masakan standar, asyik buat acara keluarga,
Alternatif tempat makan kl kemaleman,utk harga cukup mahal buat kantong saya hehehe unik,rasa masakannya cukup ok
Sangat ramai, harus antri apalagi malam minggu, pelayanannya maksimal, makanannya enak, harganya masih murah.
Harga makanan nya dah mirip2 jkt, rasa makanan OK, pas dtg malam minggu ada live music, tp cukup terganggu dg kerincingan yg ada Di tiap kaki pramusaji, krn setiap jalan pasti bunyi tuh kerincingan
Lumayan, sayang harus antre di Jam2 makan
Tempat di atas agak berdebu, mohon tuk bsa lebih bersih lagi, lain2 ok smua..
Nuansa jawa terasa dengan alunan musik gamelan jawa serta desain interior yang mendukung. Makanannya tergolong murah dan cenderung manis rasanya.
Utk m3nu sego gudeg komplitnya enak...sate lilit nya jg enak...tp syg pelayanan nya rada lama..mgkn krn over load x yaaa...so far..so good lah
Suasana enak, makanan yang dijual seperti di resto Jawa lainnya. Kebetulan belinya take away, dapetnya kemasan box plastik transparan, enak banget bawanya, anti tumpah. Lumayan merogoh kocek ya.
Menu makanan lebih enak dan beragam di Raminten satunya, di sini kita tidak banyak antre.
Berbagai macam makanan tradisional jawa tersedia dengan rasa yang enak. Suasananya juga sangat jawa
pas masuk wangu makanannya semerbak dehh. pelayanannya baiiik. atmospherenya sangat baguss
tempatnya enak, cuma makanannya kurang beragam
Asik buat nongkrong yang tidak terlalu bising. Didalamnya tenang dengan konsep jawa yang mistis.
Ambiencenya sama kayak house of raminten,  ada tembang2 jawa. Untuk makanan ga hanya makanan jawa, tapi makanan nusantara. Enak2. Recommended untuk dicoba
Kemarin kesini pas libur panjang si, jadi kan ada 2 RM cuma beda gang Yg satu bener2 rame bgt sampek Waiting list nya hampir 2 jam Akhirnya kita pindah ke satunya yg gk jauh dari situ, dan lumayan sepi, mungkin masih banyak yg belum tau juga yaaa.. So far so good si, makanannya enak, pelayanannya juga oke, tempatnya juga nyaman
Hiburan kabaret yang sangat menarik bagi wisatawan.
masakan lumayan, harga mahal, waktu makan di sana sebelah saya merokok, jadi sangat terganggu. sebaiknya dipisahkan area merokok dan bebas rokok
Makanannya enak tapi service nya kurang. Pesenannya salah2 keluarnya.
Tempat nyaman dan sajian makanan rasa istimewa
Harga cukup terjangkau, interior ruang dan suasananya nyaman
Harganya murah, Menunya variasi, Antrinya lama, Tempat duduknya sempit.
Makanan okelah, tapi dirubung lalatnya ini yg ga kuat. Terlalu banyak dan lilin udah 2x minta, ga tahan lama, jadi pasrah aja kita dikerubungi lalat. Service standar, karyawan kurang ramah🙏🏻 tapi saya komplain pesenan saya, raminten bersedia mengganti.
Soto batok murah meriah
Tempat nya unik,semua pelayan nya pake baju adat..wajib dikunjungi kalo ke Jogja
Restoran dengan style jawa dengan live music dan pelayan menggunakan pakaian khas jawa, penyajian makanan cepat, parkiran cukup untuk beberapa mobil dan motor, cocok untuk makan di tempat. Harga tergolong murah untuk resto sekelas, namun untuk makanan secara rasa menurut saya standar-standar saja.
Mengajarkan kepada anak anak habits membereskan meja makan setelah makan, cara yg unik menurut saya pribadi. Suasana siang2 panas, parkiran tergolong sempit bagi kendaraan roda 4, harga murah,  posisi nya di samping SMA, jadi apabila jam pulang sekolah, jalan ini akan macet. Makanannya tergolong enak tapi rata2 makanannya sudah dalam kondisi dingin kecuali sayur asem, lodeh dan nasi kali ya 😅, kalo minuman mah jelas ada yang panas nya 🤣, ada refill minuman dingin 👍. Yaaa so so lah ya..
Tempatnya Unik dan autentik jawa, makanan tradisional yang murah, dan rasa lumayanlah
masakan enak, banyak menu yg bisa dipilih, dan harga bersahabat..
Menu makanan dan minuman termasuk yang unik dan lawas. Harganya juga terjangkau. Tapi harus ekstra sabar buat ngantri apalagi kalau musim liburan.
Tempat lumayan rame jadi nggak disaranin buat ngajak anak kecil. Soalnya kalau pas penuh, kita musti nunggu tempat dulu di kursi depan. Nanti daftar dulu sama waiter di depan, kalau udah ada yang kosong baru dipanggil. Makanan sih bervariasi ya, kebanyakan memang khas jogja atau signature dish dari restonya sendiri. Perlu nyobain kalau ke jogja.
Konsep yang unik beda dari yang lain. Sangat bernuansa jawa. Bagi yang memiliki hidung sensitif mungkin lebih baik di lantai atas saja karena di lantai satu bau kemenyan lumanyan menyengat. Variasi menu beragam dengan harga yang affordable. Servis sangat bagus. Tersedia waiting room yang nyaman jika tempat penuh. Jadi alternatif menarik untuk tempat makan 24 jam.
Pilihan menu kurang beragam dan rasa standar. Parkir luas. Sistem pemesanan seperti fast-food(bayar dulu baru makan). Tersedia ruang ber AC dan semilir angin. Tempat bersih. Sangat cocok untuk nongkrong tapi tidak sampai larut malam. Harga kurang ramah dikantong pelajar. Pelayanan cukup baik.
Tempat makan yang terkenal di Jogjakarta. Harganya murah, pilihan menu makanan dan minuman ada banyak dengan namanya yang unik. Rasa makanan dan minumannya enak, pelayanan ok dengan staff yang ramah.  Pengunjung sangat ramai apalagi kalau weekend. Tidak heran bisa masuk waiting list sampai 30menit. Sambil menunggu nama dipanggil bisa sambil nonton tv dulu.  Yang disayangkan tempat ini tidak bisa bayar pakai debit / credit card. Jadi sebelum berkunjung, pastikan sudah bawa uang tunai yang cukup.
Bersihkan pikiran dari hal-hal yang kurang pada tempatnya kalo mampir kesini. Semua serba unik. Dari penamaan menu sampai ke penyajian sampai ke setting layout ga ada duanya. Menu masakan ala jawa. Dari yang style regular sampai extraordinary ada disini. Maksudnya dari menu "kucingan" yang represent proletar sampai masakan yang sekarang dikenal di dapur keraton bisa dinikmati disini. Mungkin ada juga menu yang harus masuk balai konservasi saking langkanya. Cocok untuk yang pengen wisata kuliner ala jogja, atau meet up sampai sekalian arisan. Harap diingat, kalau jam-jam makan atau weekend, ga boleh serobot antrian karena bakalan ada waiting list yang panjang. Hari biasa...ya lumayan lah. Nunggu bentaran. Siapin kocek agak dalam buat kesini ya....
Tempat yang wajib dikunjungi bagi yang baru pertama kali ke Jogja. Banyak makanan dan minuman unik, harga terjangkau. Rasa masakan biasa saja. Siap-siap harus mengantri dan jadi waiting list untuk makan di sini. Jarang bisa memilih tempat duduk karena dipilihkan oleh kepala pelayan.
Resto nya unik, makanannya juga unik, menu khas nusantara, porsinya lumayan besar, harga lumayan terjangkau. Pelayannya cantik dan ganteng2 pakai baju khas jawa, ornamennya juga khas sekali, bagus untuk foto-foto, kalo nongkrong bisa lupa waktu, dijam tertentu bisa banyak antrian, jd mgkn karena itu menu nya agak lama dibuatnya, tidak cocok untuk yang lapar karena akan butuh extra kesabaran menunggu makanannya dihidangkan.
Restoran jawa dengan konsep yang unik, begitu masuk kita akan disambut oleh pramusaji dengan pakaian kemben (adat jawa), mereka membawa menu dan tas kecil. Jadi setelah kita duduk dan memesan menu, kita bisa langsung membayar lewat pramusaji. Nama menu makanan dan minuman sangat unik. Rasanya juga tak kalah enak. Dilantai dasar kita bisa melihat patung Raminten berdiri dengan tangan seolah mempersilakan kita masuk, selain itu ada kursi berderet yang disediakan bagi konsumen yang ingin membawa pulang makanannya. Disitu juga terdapat kereta kuda tentunya tanpa kuda 😁, dan toko kecil yang menjual t shirt juga bakpia dan oleh-oleh khas Jogja. Selamat liburan
Utk rasa masakan mungkin bisa lebih ditingkatkan lg( kurang maknyus). Mungkin pelayannya lebih baik gak usah pakai klintingan ya....mengganggu suasana yg syahdu.
Angkringan dikemas dlm bentuk resto, artistik dan klasik, cocok untuk keluarga, mungkin utk bagian depan kanan dekat pintu masuk tdk diberi meja kursi, saat itu dipakai anak² muda ngumpul yg sering gak ngontrol suara (tertawa keras dan sesekali teriak) merusak suasana, dilantai 2 disediakan tempat yg sedikit modern buat anak² muda. Utk rasa nasi pecelnya lumayan dan harga pun terjangkau.
Makanannya lbh variatif sekarang, minumannya juga. Tempatnya unik khas raminten..sayang di lantai 2 hawanya panas. Saran mgkn bs diberi blower fan. Saat tengah hari panas sekali, apalagi jika banyak pengunjung, walaupun open circulation.
Asyik tempatnya, sungguh porsi makanannya banyak sampai nggk habis, pelayanan baik ramah dan peka terhadap customer
Makanan jawa imdonesia banget. Pelayan cukup ramah Outdoor yang sangat mampu rilekkan diri dengan aroma dupanya.
Tempat ini adalah tempat makan wajib bila ke Jogja.  Harga yang ditawarkan standar, tidak mahal dan tidak murah. Rumah Makan yang menawarkan nuansa khas Jogja dengan aroma dan berbagai macam pajangan yang ada di dalamnya.  Pelayan nya pun unik,  dengan menggunakan pakaian Jawa. Sayangnya karena selalu ramai kita harus antri terlebih dahulu (tidak disarankan datang dalam kondisi lapar)😁
Tempat makan keluarga yang santai. Ada lesehan ada duduk di meja. Tempatnya nuansa jawa klasik bagus buat foto foto. Makanan disini enak enak dan untuk ukuran kantong jakarta harga makanan disini terbilang murah. Tetapi karna populernya tempat ini membuat tempat ini hampir setiap saat penuh dan kadang harus memgantri untuk mendapatkan tempat duduk. Apalagi kalau bawa keluarga serta teman yang banyak
Menu ayam gepreknya beda dengan yang lain karena dalam 1 paket dimix dengan menu tradisional yaitu include sayur asem/lodeh plus tempe garing. Ayamnya juga crispy dan bercita rasa pedas,cocok untuk anak muda jaman now
destinasi kuliner menarik di Jogja selain gudeg dan angkringan
If you are a tourist, this restaurant is very recomended. It's Cheap, delicious, clean and worth every penny.  Dimana lagi ada makanan yang murah banget harganya, tapi tempatnya bagus kayak begini. Dan jangan salah, walau murah, rasa makanannya enak. Paling enak dateng kesini sih malam2, suasananya adem enak, nyantai, toilet juga bersih. Makanan-makanan yang disajikan juga sangat beragam.  Kalo kesini jangan lupa pesan ayam bambunya, enak banget. Dan disini yang menarik, dia ada ruang tunggunya, dan ruang tunggunya di tata cukup bagus. pengalaman yang sangat menyenangkan makan ditempat ini. dan di raminten sini buka 24 jam.
Makanan ok, minum pass tdk terlalu maniss 👍👍👍
Sebuah restoran dengan nuansa etnik yang kental, pilihan menu yang unik dan sangat memorable, serta harga yang tergolong murah. Sangat disarankan bagi turis yang baru pertama kali ke jogja. Selalu ramai, utamanya saat malam hari. Tidak disarankan untuk rombongan lebih dari 4 orang datang pada malam hari karena waiting list akan sangat lama. Bau kemenyan disini mungkin akan mengganggu bagi sebagian orang
Secara keseluruhan tempatnya unik, pelayannya juga unik, menunya beragam, mudah dijangkau tempatnya, buka 24 jam, tapi kalau mau ke sini sore/malam pasti akan jd waiting list, mending kalau mau ke sini pagi/siang hahaha
Berlokasi di kota baru, yogyakarta. Tempat makan yang bernuansa etnik jawa menyajikan beraneka menu tradisional jawa, harga yang relatif murah dan untuk rasa menurut saya "biasa saja", cocok untuk makan bareng dengan keluarga. pengalaman saya ketempat ini, antri tempat dulu karena terbatasnya tempat ( waktu2 jam makan, sore - malam)
aneka minuman dgn porsi besar jd bisa utk ramerame, makanannya enak tp gak mahal👌waiternya pake baju jawa, kerennn👍👍
Raminten kitchen terletak tidak jauh dari malioboro.. tempatnya asik buat nongkrong, di dalamnya ada horse ranch kecil. Makanannya enak enak disini dan tudak terlampau berat.. harga nya relatif murah, apalagi jika ditilik dari tempatnya yg bagus. Saya rekomendasikan nasi goreng dan ayam gepreknyA.. minuman raminten yang blue juga enak
Cocok buat tempat meeting santai, nongkrong atau sekedar ngerjain tugas sekolah/ kuliah.  Lantai 1 perlu diaktifin lagi AC-nya, karena terasa panas.  Lantai 2 nyaman sih, tapi agak berisik sama kipas yang gede.
Mf ya klau tmpt nyaman tp mungkin udah pada cape jadi saya pesan mie godog & nasi goreng asin smua ..& wkt minuman yg saya pesan masih utuh sy minta tlng untuk sy bw pulang pengemasannya kurang memuaskan ...
Tempatnya unik dan bau kembangnya wangii banget. Kalau pesen makanan langsung bayar di meja kita, waitres udah siap dengan uang kembalian. Coba datang pas siang hari, pas sepi dan ga perlu ngantri..Rekomendasi makanan,ayam koteka - campuran ayam suwir dan telur yang disajikan di batang bambu. 👍👍
Suasananya enak, asal kalo lagi ga rame.. Makanannya sebenernya so-so aja rasanya, ga hype banget tapi emang harganya cukup terjangkau dengan pilihan menu yg unik.
Tempat makan dengan suasana jawa yg kental buka 24jam, pilihan makanannya pun lumayan lengkap harganya juga terjangkau,, minusnya mungkin klo dateng agak malem atau pas weekend harus sabar ngantri buat dapetin kursi makan, sama bau kotoran kuda klo dapet tempat makan yg agak ke dalam
Berkunjung ke jogja sempatkanlah untuk mampir ke tempat makan ini karena tempat ini sedang naik daun di jogja.  Bisa jadi kita harus mengambil nomor antrean untuk mendapatkan meja. Menu beragam,  enak dan cukup murah. Juga bisa membeli oleh-oleh bakpia khas jogja.  Bakpia Raminten terasa lebih eksklusif dari pada bakpia yang lainnya karena packagingnya yang berbeda.  Semua sopir tapi,  becak,  atau ojek tahu tempat ini dan dari cerita mereka,  pemilik tempat ini adalah seorang transgender bernama Raminten.
nasi goreng ramintennya OK dan enak, ayam koteka OK,enak, tapi sidedishnya (menu pendamping terlalu monoton, salad) padahal ga semua masuk matching dengan menu utamanya... overall enak, porsi pas, minuman es teh ciamik porsinya... 🙂👍
Makanan enak, harga aman dikantong, good n romantic place. But ga rekomen kl bawa anak kecil yg suka lari sana sini, terlalu banyak pernak pernik dan tempatnya rada gelap
Banya khas dan makananna enak ! Antrianya cuup panjang bila wekend sehingga perlu dihindari kecali penasaran dengan suasana raminten. Dekat pula dengan museum sandi. Menyajikan makana khas jogja dan menu unik yang perlu dicoba.
Tempat makan yang unik suasana khas Jawa. Musik, aroma, interior, menu makanan dan minumannya semua worth it. Untuk harga masih masuk jangkauan anak kosan akhir bulan (re: tidak terlalu mahal).
Salah satu restoran favorite keluargaku, tempat nyaman tetapi harus selalu sabar mengantri untuk mendapat meja terutama jam makan malam, tetap dijaga untuk kualitas makanannya
Makanannya lumayanlah, ada WiFi, antri klo pas jam makan, kadang nunggunya lama bgt, tapi enak sih buat kumpul2
Makanannya lumayan, tempat agak panas cz saya pilih yg atas, saya suka cuminya
Delicious traditional menu to dynamic modern dessert. Worth the price. Outdoor seating is available with good lighting. Good ambience.  Since it's Jogja, expect more sweet than savory bites.
ジャワの雰囲気あるインテリアの店内で、気軽に美味しいジャワ料理が楽しめる。地元の方にも旅行者にも大人気のレストラン。席数は多いが、時間帯によっては混みます。
The menu wasn’t as verbose as the other raminten restaurant nearby. But I like the open space and the seating is less cramped. Service was nice, credit card accepted. And the food was great.
Just like other raminten universe, this place is also thick of jogja ethnic. Serving several traditonal national food, and the key point that makes it different from other raminten place is that: it opens 24 hours! Came there at around 12am, the staffs were still friendly and helpful, even though they have closed the outdoor seats settings.
Another kind of food by Raminten, more western than THoR. All day just full with student or young people for hangout or do something. My favorite menu is chicken steak here, I like the sauce. The price of the menus not too expensive and you can use your debit or credit card without minimal purchase, recommended!
24-hour restaurants • Taste: 4/5, delightful & palatable • Menu: 4/5, a varied menu of local food & local everages • Ambience: 4/5, outdoor & indoor area, 2 level open space cafe, spacious, has horse stall in the backyard, unique ornaments • Price: reasonable • Location: not in the main road • Services: friendly staff, informative • Parking lot: 3/5, available for some cars & motorbike • Overall: 4/5, worth to try!
The place is unique and clean, but the distance between chairs quite narrow. The open space mae good air circulation. The taste and price, well, like the other nowadays youngster hangout spot. Not expensive nor ceap.
We thought it'd be more or less the same as the other raminten just across the street. Honestly the food taste was great. I bought nasi goreng and wasn't expecting much but I genuinely enjoyed it. Loved the modern-Javanese atmosphere as well. Three service was such a letdown though. They were noticably understaffed. It was irritating waiting for the food for so long but I felt bad for the same waiters who had to walk the stairs back and forth. Also compared to the food price and price at the house of raminten, the price for drinks is overpriced. The cheapest drinks, iced tea, starts at 20K. They seem to justify it by serving it in an enormous serving size of glasses but no one wants to drink that much.
Some of the food are very delicious, but some of the puter food are not very well done, perhabs they could ask how the beef or chicken AGoy LS be cook, well done or rare, etc.  But service Is definitely amazing, vibes is amazing. Not a very long waiting list. Amazing ambiance! Infused water and beberages choices are varies! 🥰
The restaurant's vibe is really good if you like javanese culture environment. So many antiques furnitures. The waiter and waitress also wearing traditional javanese clothes.  The food is pretty good with fair price although it's takes too long for the food to comes out, like approximately 1 hour.  If you are hungry and need to eat immediately, I can't recommend this restaurant.  If you want to hang out with your friend and don't need to fill your stomach immediately, you can consider this restaurant.
Nice restaurant. We were trying to go to House of Raminten initially but it was too packed, but luckily they have this branch. Though different menu and a bit pricier than House of Raminten, I like the vibe here. Suitable for foreigners
You pay around IDR 25.000/ person for food, drink and service. Great.  At the beginning I pleased with the building and interior design. Dining room cozy and bathrooms are clean. Food is cheap yet limited menu. They only have ayam  geprek and fried chicken, although they put other food on menu list. This place is kids friendly. they have horse stall at their backyard, pretty entertaining for the kids. They also have open rooftop space if you prefer enjoying natural wind, but I warn you, there is a horse stall in the backyard, if you do have a super sensitive nose, the smell can ruin your appetite. This place run self services, but you only need to put dirty plate away because there are a lot helper to help.  Overall, great place, good food for family and friend gathering. I love to come back ^^
Almost perfect. Service could be a bit better. Tempe Mendoan here is perhaps the best I had in Indonesia.
Mostly outdoor resto. Serve javanese food. Average taste, a bit pricey though. Nice raminten tea, that can be refilled, and extra a box of tea leaves that can be brought home. It was mentioned free batik lesson, but turn out it was only watching the artist doing the batik.
One of the most well-known places in Yogya. This place seems like the "quick-stop" branch of House of Raminten. The place is not that large so expect waiting to get a table.  They offer various Javanese foods and they taste good. The service was also nice but a bit slow regarding the responsiveness.
Unique and traditional restaurant, we can also enjoy the dance performance of Raminten if you lucky. The place not so big so if weekend or holiday season you get some waiting list .Nice experience to get some breakfast here..sugeng rawuh
Delicious food with cheap price. We can freely take our rice and our soup that are included in the packets. And also we can refill our drink with ice tea or fresh water with lemon. We can get those with cheap price, which is very worth it. The view is also unique, there is a horse stable beside the restaurant. Also we can enjoy the view with comfortable chair and table that are made of wood. The only thing that bothers the customer here is the Wi-Fi. So i don't recommend this place for working space. And also sometimes this restaurant is very noisy, so this place is definitely not a working space. Just for chilling with our partner. Overall, very nice
This is very traditional place and of course very unique with scent everywhere. If you have a problem with scents of flowers, it is not recommended place for you. Food/drink price cheaper. It was so crowded too. Parking area is small.
Ouvert 24h/24, parfait pour manger à heure tardive. La nourriture est bonne, le service  bien que non anglophone est agréable et l'atmosphère bonne.
A new branch of Raminten restaurants, near their first restaurant. This place offers a homy and comfy hang out place with mixed tarditional and fusion main course. The price is fair due the menu presentation, but regarding the taste they could increase the presentation and ingredients, so it has place to jncrease the price a little bit. But it's of course based on their management strategy. Of course, it's a yes place to try, especially aftee they acquire the building behind and next to the place.
Really feel the Yogyakarta culture over here. The foods, waiters, building, condition, and smells show the real Yogyakarta. There is live show for a process of making Batik. Foods are delocious, waiters are good. But, this is very famous, so, sometimes you must waiting for the table.
Foods fairly cheap, nice exotic decorated restaurant, but slow service... Open 24 hours, so great for experience...
You have to wait, the food taste good enough, prices are fair, but you will come to this place for it’s experience. The interior just kinda weird but fun, tables a bit messy since they open 24-hours, but you’ll need to know what and who raminten is. Haha.  Enjoy the experience guys!
Good food, big portion, reasonable price, unique eating experience. That's what makes a Lot of queue just to eat at This place. The only bad point is that it's not that kid friendly place because the waitress cannot customise the food to a child needs.
Because it's such a hit in Jogja you have to wait in line a little longer to have a seat but there's a waiting room full of stuff & people waiting. This place is amusing & interesting!!
Open 24hr, decent food, prices are OK, unique interior design, horse stables in the back, long queue during dinner time proves that this place is loved by the locals
Good place, great atmosphere, delicious food, clean and cozy, definetly one of the  "must go and try place" in this city. Will give 5 stars if they offer non cash payment here, but unfortunately they only able to receive payment in cash, considering the pandemy and this is not an ordinary small restaurant this fact is surprised me.
It’s under renovation now but still open 24 hours. I think they should add the variation of the menu. The place is cozy and located in the heart of Yogyakarta, easy to reach.
Different from the others...but must test your patience to wait long queue....huge portions compare to prices...
Very unique place, we has good experience here, a lot of menu choices, traditional food, Indonesian food, etc, many choices for drink, with friendly prices.. and the stafs is really well manner.. thank you
Unique story about this place & they also present traditional javanese culture & food. Affordable prices too.
As usual, Raminten's places are always an unique experience, this location, Raminten's Kitchen is dedicated for bringing traditional foods to next level
Good for groups and quick bites. 24hours.
Nice place to take a rest for a while. But the menu should be more various. The price and the taste is OK
If you are expatriate and looking for a place to enjoy yogya vibes, this place is perfect for you. They offer some traditional food and drink with reasonable price There are many good spot to take picture also.
tastes slightly different from the original one with more modern building and interior
The place is cozy. I feel like I'm eating at home. The food is okay, cheap but tasty. The beverages are good, cheap too. Overall is a good place. Would like to come again
I like the food I like the place and the staff friendly, today first time I going to this restaurant and I like it, next time I would try another food
nice place with good ambience to hangout with family.
they serve a lot of javanese food. beautiful place, nice decoration but the service was not so good.
Delicious food and drink and also good for meet up with your friends
I like that they serve Sayur Asem. But unfortunately, sometimes it's served cold and it's a bit difficult for short customers, like me, to take it from the pan themselves.
Un lugar bastante pintoresco. Comida aceptable ambiente local. Mezcla diferentes tipos de comida. El precio es bastante ajustado. Merece la pena conocerlo.
Very clean and welcoming place. The food portions are really big here. The prices are reasonable. The staff are very friendly and attentive.
Good food, good place, affordable price
served unique food & beverages.. had a good javanese atmosphere here.. but long waiting list make you bored
Has few Similar menus but with more spacious environment. Try the ayam geprek. The fried chicken is one of the best in Yogya tbh.  There are beers for you who likes to drink and dine. Relatively standard for price. The waiting time could be hell if this place is crowded
The restaurant atmosphere is good.. reflect the traditional java concept. Service excellent. But sego ndeso we ordered a bit tasteless.. also need to improve more javanese menu.
Dined here yesterday and all in all I was not let down. The atmosphere here is mystical and traditional and you'll see many odd decorations around. As for the foods, they were great! Could've gone easy on the MSG but they were delicious nonetheless. The drinks were a bit too sweet for my liking, I ordered 'Monster' and all I could taste was sugar water with a hint of lemon and lemongrass. It should be the other way around. Despite all that, the pricing still makes sense. I enjoyed it!
If you want to experience the new concept of eating, just come here. You'll feel the different atmosphere right when u arrive. The uniqueness of old Java concept, tasty and unique meal, and the plus is affordable price make this place worth a try! They open 24 hours by the way
Perfect at 3am after partying! Delicious food. Great hangout. Make certain though, that the waiter lets you know if they ran out of anything before you order! :-D  We ordered 3 of one dish...waited for over 30 minutes...and he brought only one and said that it was the last one. Service is slow...but hey-- it's lovely being the only ones there!
The price is unbelievably for its quality.. strongly recommend this place for lunch
Artsy place. The food and beverage are fine. They open 24 hours
Good authentic Indonesian - Javanese restaurant...
This place offers various traditional foods and drinks with affordable price and decent taste. It operates 24 hours and is a great place to hangout with friends. The unique decoration and ornaments makes this place become a must visit place for people if they ever come to jogja.
Love the presentation of interior from "Raminten Kitchen". The ambience and design follows traditional era of Javanese style with combination of table seating and floor seating (lesehan). Food and dishes are delicious and has lots of varieties. There are many mystical beliefs hence many ornaments and displays placed. Waiting lines are very long so be sure to call for booking reservation before you come.
Great place if you want local! No tourist in there :) Atmosphere really chill, sitting on the floor, eating at low wooden table. Food and service was not excellent but like most places in Java. We had a great time feeling the local vibes.
Maaf utk sayuran di selat iga perlu tetap dijaga kesegarannya
This is a really nice and very traditional place. The food is fairly good and have a very big portion, and the price is super cheap. It open 24hr and it's good place for hanging out with family/friends. on weekend or national holiday you better prepared for long queue.
Good view so unique, Waiting list..
Supposing to be a super cheap and nice place to dine. Overall the food isn't bad, just that the queue is quite long and you may have to wait awhile. In addition, the portion may be small to foreigners, but do take note not to over order as well.  Not every table has a chair so you might be sitting on the floor mat like traditional eating places in Indo.
It's so hype, sometimes people have to queuing. But the taste good for some items.
Cozy n vintage place to hang out....
“appealing, interesting, so unique” Reviewed November 25, 2013 the atmosphere is made to create a mystical experience, with incense sticks, flowers in water container and such as. however, it's only accessories. The restaurant opens 24 hours, serving various traditional javanese or typical Yogyakarta food. The name, in Indonesian / Javanese words are sound intriguing and unusual. You can see horses and small istals on the way to restroom. Price is cheap, no need to worry, there is no hotel price in this place.
I just love the atmosphere, you can feel the scent of incenses and flowers arround the restaurant. The price is affordable and sometimes it is so crowdy, you need to wait a certain time to be seated. The foods have unique name but taste ordinary, less spices than usual indonesian food, but it isn't bad at all. The waiters are helpful and fiendly. The payment will be immediately made after you order and waiter calculate it. You'll also find souvenirs shop here.
Raminten is a spatious traditional restaurant that serve foods and drinks. The menu has unique name, delicious taste, and the price is not too expensive. It is a nice place to eat and enjoy the night with friends or family. This place is worth it to visit and you will get pleasant experience. But, you must be patient to visit this place. Because you must waiting in a queue list to eat here.
A unique and sophisticated place for hanging out. Javanese interior, great foods, and affordable prices, make this place popular among people. But consider about the time, because of the tables are limited despite of huge number of visitors.
Nice and unique menu.. I try this one called Melonkolis..
beautiful and large place. they decorated the place according to their tradition, so it creates a certain vibe. the food was good too. versatile menu of Indonesian traditional food.
The only place I know in Jogja that opens 24h. Good traditional food, nice herbal beverages, plenty of menus to choose from. Good place to hang out with your friends. One thing though, for Jakartans who are used to fast service, you need to be more patient here hehehe. And for those of you who are "sensitive", better say your prayers the second you enter the premises.
I love the original Raminten’s restaurant vibe, the Raminten’s Kitchen gave a different vibes from the original one (which  located just 500 meters apart), but it was fancy and comfortable, the food choices are authentic and traditional. The bonus part is they had this javanese ritual or ceremony to respect the food, every 21.00pm. The price is a little bit pricey, and you must be patient enough to wait for the food to be serve.
July 2023  Very decent local food with good ambience (sit on the garden grounds for a true local experience)!  This is prob a better option for tourist than House of Raminten (it's very very crowded there).
A very comfortable place to eat, to talk with friends/colleagues or just to study. The place is clean, the service is fast, and the food is delicious! It might get a little crowded in the noon, though, but overall, I'd love to visit here again.
Raminten kitchen is different to House of Raminten. The concept is more casual. I'd say it is like Raminten express. But they have a cozy and clean place. Food is ok. Not so much option but still in a good standard. Considering that the location is not in the main road, it is perfect for your simple getaway with friends or even just yourself alone.
If you are interest in Javanese traditional foods and atmosphere, you have to go to this place
Interesting place with Javanese signature. The foods are normal and the price is okay. Not my favorite place because it is very touristy now. But I like the ambience here.
Last week I went there. It was crowded., It was holiday season. Unique place ,and unique menu. LOL😄 Nice place to do chit chat with friends. I ordered monster drink ( ginger,lemon, lemongrass) and fried rice. I take home the little poster. "Raminten" 😊
Extremely affordable place to eat but just know the food is reasonable with the price. The food is decent if you're looking for a place for cheap eats and quirky atmosphere.  I would call to make a quick reservation before going. This place is extremely busy with locals.
The place has its own vibes. Youll find a good service with a very strong javanese culture. With such place with a stable in it, it doesnt smells that bad, eventhough you must go throught the stable if you wanted to go to the bathroom. A very delicate place
nice restaurant... provide a lot kind of meal... have to queue for eat there... but (for me) i did'nt like the smell from "dupa"... make me hard to breath... and for musholla is too small... only enough for 4... and the sit for lesehan not comfort for me... but over all nice...
If you like to sit down low this place is the go. Great food and a very different atmosphere. Theatre seating waiting area. Horse stables near the toilets. Check out the lovely big lady.
It's a unique place, with unique interior design.. So traditional like you can smell "menyan" haha.. I have to be on queue line for like half an hour, but it's worth the wait bcz they've got nice foods with affordable prices.
Get ready to wait for a long time. This place is better as a hangout than as a diner, so if you want a quick bite, you had better go somewhere else. If you want to hang out, they have a variety of funny beverages and foods.
Delicious Food at cozy place with reasonable price
The food is good and beautifully cheap. The decoration is oddly nice and the is quite comfortable. So, come here next time you stop by in Yogyakarta.
This restaurant is not the same as the other house of raminten.. They serve ayam geprek and friend rice as their main menu.. And they have a unique concept that after their costumers finish their meals they have to clean it up themselves.. But the atmosphere is nice and clean, and if you go there in the afternoon you can see the horse racing course just next to the restaurant..
Really love the concept of Javanese culture in it. The menu is good even it's little bit pricy. They use close bill system. It is perfect for group dining.
All menus are traditional foods from Jogja and Central Java, the taste is good and exactly have a friendly price. The place and ambience is very traditional with some gamelan music.
The place is iconic with its traditional Javanese look. The service is also pretty fast and good. However, you have to be smart when you choose the menu because some are a bit pricey
House of Raminten. Antree tp unique dan cepat
Great foods with the cheap price! The place was also good for hanging out with friends. For studying or do some work maybe you can use the 2nd floor of the restaurant.
Enak tapi mistic ada patung n sajen bungaaan
24 hours ethnical restaurant with cheap price. Must wait first sometimes, because it's very crowd. The service also good and fast, I really love to be here. But I feel uncomfortable with the  smells.
The must added place to visit if you are come to Yogyakarta, the food is good and the place gives the essence of yogyakarta culture. The food also is traditional and can match everyone taste ( i think ) haha
People use to go here while waiting for The House of Raminten. This place was a place where the parents usually waiting for their kids (there's a lot of schools near the place) or having a social gathering. They have what we call as millenials food or hype food such as "smashed chicken" and other home food like "sour soup" that they don't sold in The House of Raminten. You do the self service here. They serve your food at the cashier, then you have to take it yourself, then clean up the mess at the place that have been reserved for clean up. A good way to teach self respect and respect to others.
Dood was AMAZING. Cheap price for Urban people. 24 hours open. Limited parking space. Better drop off only.
One of the most popular restaurant in Yogyakarta. It offers wide variations of local cuisines such as tahu telor and bistik. Surprisingly, the price is affordable and could be consideres as cheap.
Etnics Place for Hangout......, very crowded and waiting list for order
Great place. It's kinda have a mythycal feeling when you enter the place. Great decoration. As for the drinks it's too sweetfor me. So if you are a sweet lover. This might be a place for you.
nice place to eat java traditional food. but low respon
A uniquely-designed restaurant, accentuated with Javanese style. The staff is clothed in Javanese style, too. The foods and drinks are so-so. The place is a bit creepy with some incense smell, I guess..
Always crowded. Strangely interesting vibe, fascinating decoration. All the staff here are friendly. All you need to do to be able to survive to enjoy this place is by being patient.
Nice place, nice food and best for price :)
Ayam Kremes was an incredible meal. It was oozing with lemon grass flavor. Just wished they served faster here; i waited for a long time in the queue.
24 hours restaurant with good menu! Love it!
Tempate penak nggo nongkrong, ono kandang manuk & jaran sak isine. Panganane enak tp wedange rodo larang. Betewe mangut lelene endes.. 😁
This place actually feels slightly the same like it main restaurant, house of raminten. It has the same atmosphere, cozy place cheap meals. Overall I think it was a good lunch experience .
Taste of foods quite good, no queue when I visit, no wait long time for food and drink.
Cozy place to gather with your friends. You can feel the Javanese atmosphere here. Food price affordable, the taste also ok.
Find a simple food and you can see horse here, good for student because the price are acceptable, but if you eat on the 2nd floor you can smelt the horse.... Ups dont forget to clean your table by yourself
Good place to hangout, pretty strategic place, gets crowded on weekends especially night time, price for food and drinks are affordable, but food tastes basic, space wise it's big enough, smoking and non smoking are available
Nice place to relax, with an economic price
One of the unique restaurant in Yogyakarta owned by Hamzah Sulaeman, the owner of famed Mirota and Hamzah Batik. The price of food and beverages in The House of Raminten was cheap, for the serving,  you have to wait for a while  if you come here on the weekend or on the holiday.
What I ate was very delicious!  The service was friendly, nice, but not enough for 5 * !
Good Place !! Ada tempat mbatik nya dan ada stable horse nya jugaaa ❤ tempat murah dan enak buat kumpul2 dan makan bersama kelurga ⚡
Do not come here during weekend, lunch time and dinner time so crowded and you will waiting list. Price cheap with variant menu of traditional food.
Raminten Kitchen is an extension of the House of Raminten. Its targeted guests are younger people such as university students and thus, their menu is simpler (ayam penyet and the like). The place is instagramable and suitable for a get together
This place has traditional ethnic concept. Very good for tourism. But it maybe uncomfortable for moslem or somepoeple because smells of 'Kemenyan'
A unique restaurant with "sesajen" everywhere. Price are cheap for a generous serving size. Hard to find a parking place, you have to park on the side of the road.
Suitable for normal chit-chat with friends (more than two people is preferred). Special for its slow service, which allows visitor to enjoy the chatter.
Unique and affordable restaurant. Has a lot of different kind of menu. Usually too crowded so we have to wait until we got seat.
A lot of options in the menu, good services and fast response, most important its cheap, worth for backpackers pocket, but little bit unhygienic, there's dust in few place, overall raminten its wort to eat
Nice food and nice price
Makanan cukup enak, nasi boleh ambil sepuasnya tapi hanya boleh sekali, minum boleh Refill
Food taste is standar, but nice service. The employees are friendly. Oh and we'll learn abt self service there.
The cakes are vary from traditional cake (klepon, lemper, arem-arem) to western cake. The meals are also very nice: oxtail soup, buntil, oseng pare, kikil, etc.
Very crowded as always, except after 1 AM. Think the food tastes better now. A unique magical atmosphere.
So thematic. Really like this place. The choice of food is quite a lot, tasty and cheap! The waiter is also friendly.
Tried this since it's on top of the list of must try resto in Jogja, but the wait was super too long. Quite popular among the local travellers.
The one around Kotabaru is the best.Long line for seats to be available.Friendly staff..and great local javanese cuisine with big portion and reasonable price.
Uniqe place to taste traditional food with javanese culture touch. The menu option are extra and the price affordable
It’s nice I was here visiting with my office mate. I ordered chicken “Koteka” and hot ginger with milk, the taste is good.
Although it's not a wide place, it's comfortable. I love the fragrance around it. For food price, it's not cheap and not expensive. Just right in the middle.
Very cozy place but hopefully they put the fan on the 2nd floor because it's too hot in the day
Unique place but still cozy. And most important is the price is cheap but comes with extra size and delicious food
Unique place, good menu the portion of your meal is affordable with the price. At the night you must be passion for get the table.
Nice place, plenty choice of food with very reasonable price. But the place is really full on weekend nite, be prepared to be in the waiting list.
It's 24 hours. Serve good food and friendly price. And ... they have horses at the back. Cute! ❤
This place isnt too crowded like the other raminten place, but the menu isn't as complete as the other place. It's a nice place to hang.
Tasty food with cheap price but avoid to visit in saturday night, you will find long waiting list.
The place has good ambiance and the food is good but the service a bit slow.
The interrior is very traditional and unique. The price was incredibly cheap. And.. oh.. they have real horse on the back kitchen.
Its about the place unique vibrant eclectic javanese vibe. A place to enjoy service and a touch of rainbow to brighten Yogya days :)
Interesting place, witty name of the dishes that taste so-so. Good experiece overall
Nice place, noce foods, worthy prices. The only problem is there wasnt parking lots for the car, so be prepared for parking at the roadside
Cheap and good food. You have to pay cash first during the order. Smoking allowed inside.
Angklung live music was so not enjoyable.... Food was OK and taste good. Price was cheap
Well it's great place to hangout, but i don't really like the fried rice.

Nice place to hangout, low price but moderate taste of dishes
relatively affordable price, good environment, have to be very patient waiting for the food.
The name, Raminten, comes from a character that Hamzah, raminten's owner, used to perform on a soap opera aired weekly on Jogja TV
A unique place to dine in but it is far too crowded and badly lit for my taste.
Good food, good price. The ambience also nice here..
Good ambience n food, too bad over crowded..  but i think the food is worth it :)
